just like a certain type of architecture requires a particular array of materials, so also a certain type of materials seems to have implicit within itself a particular array of possible architectures.

cosmogony: a process of creation of that particular universe

'likely story’ – eikos mythos... cosmogonic tale

My likely story unfolds as follows. The character of our contemporary existential experience, points towards a certain type of ordering of our world, and of ourselves within it. This ordering is superficially social/economic/etc., but in fact derives from a set of fundamental metaphysical axioms. These __axioms combine together in__ an overall system, which is the __reality-system__ of our age. A __reality-system shapes the world in a certain way, and endows it with a particular destiny__: it is the __cosmological form__ that __defines a historical age__. At the same time, however, __it is also a cosmogonic force__: its metaphysical settings and parameters actually create the __world__ – if for ‘world’, as the Greek cosmos or the Latin mundus, we understand precisely the __product of an act of ordering chaos__. Here comes the mythological aspect of my eikos mythos. It is possible, narratively at least, to present this cosmogonic force as almost a thing, whose worldmaking activity is revealed by its internal structure. I chose to call the cosmogonic form of our age, ‘Technic’.

p20

Technic is just one possible cosmogonic force, and only one possible form of reality. Without doubt it enjoys hegemonic status today

__but this doesn’t make it any less contingent than any other possible form of reality.__ 

__reality-systems are contingent conglomerates of metaphysical axioms, ... their modification is always possible.__ Indeed, we are always able to modify our own reality-settings beyond the diktats of our social context, even when history tells us that we are powerless and stuck.

p29

__‘reality’ is the name that we assign to a state in which the dimension of essence (what something is) and the dimension of existence (that something is) are inextricably bound to each other, without merging__ into one another.
    The earliest theoretical distinction of essence and existence is traditionally attributed to Ibn Sina (Avicenna). However, it has recently been argued that it might date back even earlier to the work of ninth-century Iraqi philosopher Al-Kindi


__*Reality is a weave made of essence and existence*__, like warp and weft, and the event of its undoing requires a weaver (for de Martino, a ‘magician’) that is capable of interlacing the two back together, regardless of the specific forms and colours that each of them can take.
<!-- That's some shagrit shit right here!!! -->

This is the age of metaphysical nihilism: the nihilism that sets the background on fire and undoes the very fabric of reality. Under its attack, ‘everything can become everything, that is to say: nothingness emerges’. 
<!-- Yeah, hm, idunno, sounds quite rad, actually. -->

p30
Once left unbound, __grammar separates essences from existence, reduces the former to mere positioning within a syntactic series, and annuls the latter as unnecessary and spurious__. What are ‘things’ nowadays, apart from signposts of the position they occupy within the productive syntax of technology, economics or societal norms? __Like a novel reduced to pure grammar, the present age has shunned the question of meaning as a sign of superstition and nostalgia__, while relegating reality to the status of an obsolete concept which is to be overcome if we wish to fully unleash our productive potential.
<!-- Ugh, I hope you're not pulling a Baudrillard on me. I can't with his whining. This is not nihilism. Or maybe nihilism is good, actually. I'm so tired of this "phones bad" narrative. Phones are. And it is quite fascinating. -->

p32

such __an archetypal leaf__ – unlike the mythical Urpflanze that
he sought at first, and then abandoned – __is nowhere to be found; it doesn’t quite exist in the same way that historical ancestors or Platonic ideas are supposed to do.__ Although __it provides__, so to say, __the melodic centre around which a certain kind of entities orbit, it is itself irreducible to any specific, existing entity.__ 

We can consider this kind of analysis to be morphological, in that it takes as the defining quality of a thing or of an aggregate of things, their participation to a particular ‘form’, of which the archetype constitutes the fundamental and original theme. As long as the variations on the archetype remain faithful to the range of possibilities inscribed in its theme, we encounter a representative of a certain type of entity – while as soon as the variations exceeds the internal limits of the archetype, thus betraying the form, then we must admit that we are facing another type of entity altogether. __The morphological approach, despite its shortcomings, provides a method to create an order (and thus a name) out of extremely complex phenomena, while at the same time respecting their complexity and avoiding reducing them to mere products of such an order or name.__

p34

First World War was the dawn not just of a new kind of ‘warfare of materials’, but of an altogether new kind of reality. From the murderous flood that had buried the reality of old, a new cosmic order was about to emerge – and the experience of this passage left Jünger at once utterly __paralysed and strangely exhilarated.__ 
    Here, and really only here, I was to observe that there is a quality of __dread__ that feels as unfamiliar as a foreign country. In moments __when I felt it, I experienced no fear as such but a kind of exalted, almost demoniacal lightness.__ ... The ability to think logically and the feeling of gravity, both seemed to have been removed. We had the sensation of the ineluctable and the unconditionally necessary, as if we were facing an elemental force.
    (E. Jünger, Storm of Steel, London: Penguin, 2004, pp. 93, 95.)

p35

In his 1954 essay The Question Concerning Technology, Heidegger develops a number of themes previously sketched by Jünger and other interwar authors, to define exactly what we can understand as the essence of technology. He articulated his answer between the notions of Gestell (enframing) and of instrumentality. Anything that appears to us as a ‘true’ element of the world (that is, anything whose truthfulness, aletheia, consists in the removal of the veil that hid it from us, and its emergence as an object of our experience), does so within a certain frame. Enframing is thus a necessary process for us to be able to experience the world, as it allows us to understand things as clear and distinct entities. __The essence of technology consists in a specific way of enframing the world, which unveils it as a ‘stock-pile of standing-reserve’, that is as nothing but the accumulated instrumental value of everything and anything.__ A forest is no longer a forest, but a stockpile of timber ready to be sent to production; a waterfall is no longer a waterfall, but a stockpile of hydro-electrical units ready to be extracted; a person is no longer a person, but a stockpile of labour read y to be employed; and so on. Thus, Heidegger points out, __the essence of technology is nothing technological in itself__, but ‘the gathering together of that setting-upon which sets upon man, i.e., challenges him forth, to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve’.

p36

What else is Technic as the essence of technology, but the spirit of __absolute instrumentality, according to which everything is merely a means to an end__ – where the only ultimate end is, once again, the limitless expansion of the accumulated productive ability?

According to __Simondon__, a thing (any thing, from a crystal to a single person to large social groups) is never stably individuated as ‘that’ thing, but it is in a continuous process of actualization of its original, overflowing potential. As the process of individuation unfolds, we witness the procession of a long series of ‘individuals’, each defined by the specific limits of its interaction with what constitute its surrounding at that particular stage. Beyond the actualized series of individuals, however, a boundless wealth of potentiality always lies unrealized. __Within this system, technology functions essentially as the mediator between an individual and its surroundings:__ it is the very process through which an individual negotiates its own limits, and thus its own form, in the context of a mutual relation with th e world around it. As such, technology is both a network of relations, and the very process of defining individuals

p38

if __any individual is both its own technology and its own product__, perhaps our real mistake lies in the very notion of technology as an autonomous field.

p39

If until that point the architectural project of a building functioned as __a complete narrative, readable but not reducible to its syntactic elements__, __then__ with the triumph of modular architecture the very essence of a building was __reduced to an assemblage of grammatical positions.__ This __shift of perspective saw the transformation__ of the relationship between human and building, __from one based on meaning, to one based on a grammar of functionality__. 
<!-- Oh, that's what storytelling is going through too, huh. Relationship between human and text. 
And, ffs, I'm _not_ going for a thing bad take. Reduction is a valuable tool of analysis. In fact, you can't do any analysis at all if you don't do at least a little reduction, a little idealization. What's important is to remember that this is only a framework—one of many possible. -->

Perhaps unwittingly, the proponents of modular architecture had translated on the metaphorical level of construction, __the same cosmological transformation that Technic, as the form of the age, was enforcing on the whole of reality__.
<!-- That's a problem right here. Though, again, even trying to analyze the whole of reality through Technic not bad per se, I'd say. But believing that this is the true truth one and only. -->

p40

__ontology of positions rather than of things__.  This ontological paradigm is the same that is at work within the regime of Technic.

Like every form, that imposed by Technic is determined by the structure of its inner geometry. ... this geometry is composed by two fundamental and seemingly contradictory elements: the notions of measure and infinity.

Technic’s rewriting of reality can be summed up, at least superficially, to its __positing instrumentality as the only legitimate ontological stance__
<!-- The following elaboration is about production (capitalism), but this works for purpose too, doesn't it? The notion of being creating with a purpose is exactly that: ontological reduction to instrumentality. -->

Yet, the concept of instrumentality isn’t completely self-sufficient; in order to stand, it needs to rely on other, more fundamental concepts. 
<!-- Uhm, no? -->
At the heart of instrumentality, and necessarily implied by it, we find the notion of causality.

p41

there can be such a thing as an instrument, only if that instrument is capable of producing something else as the direct effect of its activity.
<!-- Uhm, what _can't_ produce something else through activity? A stone is an instrument, one of the oldest. Rain can be seen as an instrument: irrigation produces crops. -->

there could be no instruments, if we didn’t already have a more general concept of cause–effect relationships.
<!-- Ahhhh, okay, got it. Agree. -->

Yet, the concept of causality is not as plain and unproblematic as it might appear at first. 
<!-- Hehe, oh yeah :D -->

As theorized by David Hume, the idea that something can be the cause of something else is not a matter of fact, which we can easily find in our immediate experience of the world. Conversely, argues Hume, what we witness is simply the sequential order in which the activity of what we call the cause precedes the activity of what we call the effect: a flame touches a piece of paper, and then the paper takes fire. __The force of causality is not a natural force, but merely something that we project over the succession of events in nature.__ 
<!-- YES. So Hume was first to write about that. -->

__Causality is an arbitrary notion, yet we seem to be unable to do without it.__ Indeed, causality reveals more how we understand the existent, or how the existent unveils itself to us, than anything about how the existent is structured in itself.

p42

However, our experience of the world is filtered not only by our ‘naturally’ inbuilt categories, but also by the specific reality-system that is hegemonic during each historical age, and through which the world emerges to us as one particular world.

p44

As the foundation of Technic’s language, and thus of its system of serial production, the notion of measure consists in the original act of ‘cutting up’ the world, in a manner that makes it available to be infinitely recombined. Or, more precisely, __measure is the act of creating the world as a catalogue of cuts__ – while before measure’s ‘cutting’ no such thing as a world, or indeed anything at all, actually existed. The process of measuring, that is of ‘creating-by- cutting’, is infinitely replicable – in the same way that serial production in Technic’s world can expand ad infinitum.
