FEDERICO CAMPAGNA: Technic and Magic, The Reconstruction of Reality 


# Introduction
p18

just like a certain type of architecture requires a particular array of materials, so also a certain type of materials seems to have implicit within itself a particular array of possible architectures. 

p19
cosmogony: a process of creation of that particular universe

'likely story’ – eikos mythos... cosmogonic tale

My likely story unfolds as follows. The character of our contemporary existential experience, points towards a certain type of ordering of our world, and of ourselves within it. This ordering is superficially social/economic/etc., but in fact derives from a set of fundamental metaphysical axioms. These __axioms combine together in__ an overall system, which is the __reality-system__ of our age. A __reality-system shapes the world in a certain way, and endows it with a particular destiny__: it is the __cosmological form__ that __defines a historical age__. At the same time, however, __it is also a cosmogonic force__: its metaphysical settings and parameters actually create the __world__ – if for ‘world’, as the Greek cosmos or the Latin mundus, we understand precisely the __product of an act of ordering chaos__. Here comes the mythological aspect of my eikos mythos. It is possible, narratively at least, to present this cosmogonic force as almost a thing, whose worldmaking activity is revealed by its internal structure. I chose to call the cosmogonic form of our age, ‘Technic’.

p20

Technic is just one possible cosmogonic force, and only one possible form of reality. Without doubt it enjoys hegemonic status today

__but this doesn’t make it any less contingent than any other possible form of reality.__ 

__reality-systems are contingent conglomerates of metaphysical axioms, ... their modification is always possible.__ Indeed, we are always able to modify our own reality-settings beyond the diktats of our social context, even when history tells us that we are powerless and stuck.

# Technic's world
p29

__‘reality’ is the name that we assign to a state in which the dimension of essence (what something is) and the dimension of existence (that something is) are inextricably bound to each other, without merging__ into one another.
    The earliest theoretical distinction of essence and existence is traditionally attributed to Ibn Sina (Avicenna). However, it has recently been argued that it might date back even earlier to the work of ninth-century Iraqi philosopher Al-Kindi


__*Reality is a weave made of essence and existence*__, like warp and weft, and the event of its undoing requires a weaver (for de Martino, a ‘magician’) that is capable of interlacing the two back together, regardless of the specific forms and colours that each of them can take.
<!-- That's some shagrit shit right here!!! -->

This is the age of metaphysical nihilism: the nihilism that sets the background on fire and undoes the very fabric of reality. Under its attack, ‘everything can become everything, that is to say: nothingness emerges’. 
<!-- Yeah, hm, idunno, sounds quite rad, actually. -->

p30
Once left unbound, __grammar separates essences from existence, reduces the former to mere positioning within a syntactic series, and annuls the latter as unnecessary and spurious__. What are ‘things’ nowadays, apart from signposts of the position they occupy within the productive syntax of technology, economics or societal norms? __Like a novel reduced to pure grammar, the present age has shunned the question of meaning as a sign of superstition and nostalgia__, while relegating reality to the status of an obsolete concept which is to be overcome if we wish to fully unleash our productive potential.
<!-- Ugh, I hope you're not pulling a Baudrillard on me. I can't with his whining. This is not nihilism. Or maybe nihilism is good, actually. I'm so tired of this "phones bad" narrative. Phones are. And it is quite fascinating. -->

p32

such __an archetypal leaf__ – unlike the mythical Urpflanze that
he sought at first, and then abandoned – __is nowhere to be found; it doesn’t quite exist in the same way that historical ancestors or Platonic ideas are supposed to do.__ Although __it provides__, so to say, __the melodic centre around which a certain kind of entities orbit, it is itself irreducible to any specific, existing entity.__ 

We can consider this kind of analysis to be morphological, in that it takes as the defining quality of a thing or of an aggregate of things, their participation to a particular ‘form’, of which the archetype constitutes the fundamental and original theme. As long as the variations on the archetype remain faithful to the range of possibilities inscribed in its theme, we encounter a representative of a certain type of entity – while as soon as the variations exceeds the internal limits of the archetype, thus betraying the form, then we must admit that we are facing another type of entity altogether. __The morphological approach, despite its shortcomings, provides a method to create an order (and thus a name) out of extremely complex phenomena, while at the same time respecting their complexity and avoiding reducing them to mere products of such an order or name.__

p34

First World War was the dawn not just of a new kind of ‘warfare of materials’, but of an altogether new kind of reality. From the murderous flood that had buried the reality of old, a new cosmic order was about to emerge – and the experience of this passage left Jünger at once utterly __paralysed and strangely exhilarated.__ 
    Here, and really only here, I was to observe that there is a quality of __dread__ that feels as unfamiliar as a foreign country. In moments __when I felt it, I experienced no fear as such but a kind of exalted, almost demoniacal lightness.__ ... The ability to think logically and the feeling of gravity, both seemed to have been removed. We had the sensation of the ineluctable and the unconditionally necessary, as if we were facing an elemental force.
    (E. Jünger, Storm of Steel, London: Penguin, 2004, pp. 93, 95.)

p35

In his 1954 essay The Question Concerning Technology, Heidegger develops a number of themes previously sketched by Jünger and other interwar authors, to define exactly what we can understand as the essence of technology. He articulated his answer between the notions of Gestell (enframing) and of instrumentality. Anything that appears to us as a ‘true’ element of the world (that is, anything whose truthfulness, aletheia, consists in the removal of the veil that hid it from us, and its emergence as an object of our experience), does so within a certain frame. Enframing is thus a necessary process for us to be able to experience the world, as it allows us to understand things as clear and distinct entities. __The essence of technology consists in a specific way of enframing the world, which unveils it as a ‘stock-pile of standing-reserve’, that is as nothing but the accumulated instrumental value of everything and anything.__ A forest is no longer a forest, but a stockpile of timber ready to be sent to production; a waterfall is no longer a waterfall, but a stockpile of hydro-electrical units ready to be extracted; a person is no longer a person, but a stockpile of labour read y to be employed; and so on. Thus, Heidegger points out, __the essence of technology is nothing technological in itself__, but ‘the gathering together of that setting-upon which sets upon man, i.e., challenges him forth, to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve’.

p36

What else is Technic as the essence of technology, but the spirit of __absolute instrumentality, according to which everything is merely a means to an end__ – where the only ultimate end is, once again, the limitless expansion of the accumulated productive ability?

According to __Simondon__, a thing (any thing, from a crystal to a single person to large social groups) is never stably individuated as ‘that’ thing, but it is in a continuous process of actualization of its original, overflowing potential. As the process of individuation unfolds, we witness the procession of a long series of ‘individuals’, each defined by the specific limits of its interaction with what constitute its surrounding at that particular stage. Beyond the actualized series of individuals, however, a boundless wealth of potentiality always lies unrealized. __Within this system, technology functions essentially as the mediator between an individual and its surroundings:__ it is the very process through which an individual negotiates its own limits, and thus its own form, in the context of a mutual relation with th e world around it. As such, technology is both a network of relations, and the very process of defining individuals

p38

if __any individual is both its own technology and its own product__, perhaps our real mistake lies in the very notion of technology as an autonomous field.

p39

If until that point the architectural project of a building functioned as __a complete narrative, readable but not reducible to its syntactic elements__, __then__ with the triumph of modular architecture the very essence of a building was __reduced to an assemblage of grammatical positions.__ This __shift of perspective saw the transformation__ of the relationship between human and building, __from one based on meaning, to one based on a grammar of functionality__. 
<!-- Oh, that's what storytelling is going through too, huh. Relationship between human and text. 
And, ffs, I'm _not_ going for a thing bad take. Reduction is a valuable tool of analysis. In fact, you can't do any analysis at all if you don't do at least a little reduction, a little idealization. What's important is to remember that this is only a framework—one of many possible. -->

Perhaps unwittingly, the proponents of modular architecture had translated on the metaphorical level of construction, __the same cosmological transformation that Technic, as the form of the age, was enforcing on the whole of reality__.
<!-- That's a problem right here. Though, again, even trying to analyze the whole of reality through Technic not bad per se, I'd say. But believing that this is the true truth one and only. -->

p40

__ontology of positions rather than of things__.  This ontological paradigm is the same that is at work within the regime of Technic.

Like every form, that imposed by Technic is determined by the structure of its inner geometry. ... this geometry is composed by two fundamental and seemingly contradictory elements: the notions of measure and infinity.

Technic’s rewriting of reality can be summed up, at least superficially, to its __positing instrumentality as the only legitimate ontological stance__
<!-- The following elaboration is about production (capitalism), but this works for purpose too, doesn't it? The notion of being creating with a purpose is exactly that: ontological reduction to instrumentality. -->

Yet, the concept of instrumentality isn’t completely self-sufficient; in order to stand, it needs to rely on other, more fundamental concepts. 
<!-- Uhm, no? -->
At the heart of instrumentality, and necessarily implied by it, we find the notion of causality.

p41

there can be such a thing as an instrument, only if that instrument is capable of producing something else as the direct effect of its activity.
<!-- Uhm, what _can't_ produce something else through activity? A stone is an instrument, one of the oldest. Rain can be seen as an instrument: irrigation produces crops. -->

there could be no instruments, if we didn’t already have a more general concept of cause–effect relationships.
<!-- Ahhhh, okay, got it. Agree. -->

Yet, the concept of causality is not as plain and unproblematic as it might appear at first. 
<!-- Hehe, oh yeah :D -->

As theorized by David Hume, the idea that something can be the cause of something else is not a matter of fact, which we can easily find in our immediate experience of the world. Conversely, argues Hume, what we witness is simply the sequential order in which the activity of what we call the cause precedes the activity of what we call the effect: a flame touches a piece of paper, and then the paper takes fire. __The force of causality is not a natural force, but merely something that we project over the succession of events in nature.__ 
<!-- YES. So Hume was first to write about that. -->

__Causality is an arbitrary notion, yet we seem to be unable to do without it.__ Indeed, causality reveals more how we understand the existent, or how the existent unveils itself to us, than anything about how the existent is structured in itself.

p42

However, our experience of the world is filtered not only by our ‘naturally’ inbuilt categories, but also by the specific reality-system that is hegemonic during each historical age, and through which the world emerges to us as one particular world.

p44

As the foundation of Technic’s language, and thus of its system of serial production, the notion of measure consists in the original act of ‘cutting up’ the world, in a manner that makes it available to be infinitely recombined. Or, more precisely, __measure is the act of creating the world as a catalogue of cuts__ – while before measure’s ‘cutting’ no such thing as a world, or indeed anything at all, actually existed. The process of measuring, that is of ‘creating-by- cutting’, is infinitely replicable – in the same way that serial production in Technic’s world can expand ad infinitum. 

p48

__death__ implies something ceasing to exist as that specific, individual, living thing. __Extinction__ befalls an abstract category, typically an animal or plant species. ... Death applies to unique ‘things’; extinction to positions in a series of linguistic classifications. _While from the perspective of a struggle against death, only the actual living existence of a specific individual can be considered a success, within the logic of a struggle against extinction, what counts is the preservation of the possibility to activate a certain position._

p49

__the phobic hegemony of extinction reflects the silent consensus over a reality-system that sees serial positions such as species, as more ‘real’, and thus worthier of protection, than individual living things.__

Potential presence takes the place of actual existence.

p50

[Technic is] translating the world of things (trees, waterfalls, humans), into a world of positions, immediately understandable as standing-reserves within the industrial series of production (timber, hydroelectric units, labour).

Jünger correctly pointed out that __the bourgeois idea of the individual was soon to capitulate to the ‘type of the worker’__

In order to subjugate the world of things to its own cosmos of positions, Industrial Technic proceeded by turning things into their linguistic equivalents within its own series-systems. __Things__ weren’t just generally __reduced to their name__; specifically, they were translated into their technical names. 

p51

Once an exclusive principle takes over the whole, and denies the legitimacy of anything outside its own architecture, then reality is in peril.

p52

at the basis of the contemporary obsessions with so-called ‘Big Data’ lies the double ontological assumption that: (1) the language of information technology is capable of grasping the whole of the existent; (2) more extremely, the whole of the existent coincides with the reach of the language of information technology.

<!-- Yeah, hmm, not sure about that, fam. There are hard-core positivists in the field, probably, but like a model is a model is a model. Scientists usually know that they're using a model. And the ideas of social constructivism are quite prominent, at least in leftist circles. -->

The record-shattering investments in Big-Data systems and technology rest on the belief that there can’t possibly be anything ontologically relevant that couldn’t, at least potentially, be reduced (and reduced truthfully) to the serial units of the language of data.
<!-- Or maybe they just use this new tool, which is Big-Data, because it already yielded somewhat satisfactory results. Like numerical solution of equations is pretty similar. So it makes sense to extrapolate and try using this tool on other stuff.
No doubt some people believe they're extracting truth with this tool, and they probably do extract some truth, but is it so prevalent? Most people aren't hard core positivists, because most people aren't hard core (by definition). Though, people are very easily bullshited by numbers, I'll give you that. -->

one same principle across the horizon of contemporary cultural forms. According to it, __there is no possible presence outside the infinite horizon of serial language__, as there is no legitimate presence outside the specific linguistic series that act as the historical gatekeepers of an ontology of positions. 

p55

__Technic demands no obedience__ – indeed, it doesn’t demand anything. Technic’s cosmology __sets a filter that allows access to a status of legitimate presence in the world__, only to those who have undergone a fundamental mutation in their ontological structure, and thus also in their position as ethical subjects. In this sense, the __metaphysical policing enacted by Technic is always a form of border control, enforcing the most profound kind of discrimination.__

## Symbolism of flat and spherical Earth
p57

__Understood symbolically, the image of a flat Earth points to two intuitive objects of human experience: that the inhabitable world of each of us is at once shaped and enhanced by its limits, and that beyond these limits lies, not ‘nothing’ but something at once altogether different and yet contiguous.__ Conversely, the symbol of a spherical Earth hints at a different ontological vision, according to which the world stretches without boundaries, seamlessly closed onto itself, while outside of its smooth surface it is possible to find either nothing at all, or other equivalent spheres, that is repetitions of the same form of existence.

we can interpret the contemporary fantasy of a world of antiquity stuck in the belief of a Flat Earth, as the case of a __‘subject supposed to believe’__, Slavoj Žižek’s own reinterpretation and expansion of Lacan’s concept of a ‘subject supposed to know’.

p58 

Our contemporaries attribute the belief in a flat Earth to pre-modern ignoramuses, because __we all believe, hope and indeed know very well that the Earth is flat. The symbol of a flat Earth, that is, of a world that is at once shaped and enhanced by its limits, and which is not surrounded merely by nothingness or sameness but that also allows radical alterity, speaks more profoundly and truthfully to our experience than that of a spherical Earth.__ Whatever in us still resists Technic’s call for absolute ontological conformity, for a ‘final solution’ into nothingness of anything that isn’t reducible to serial language, whatever in us still resists this knows, hopes and believes in an alternative cosmology to the claustrophobic sphere of Technic. Yet, such dangerous hope and knowledge shouldn’t be displayed too publicly; better to attribute it to somebody else, somebody distant enough to be unable to find us out – like the ancients. 

The former type of ontology allows for a plurality of types and levels of existence, while recognizing the specificity of each one within their constitutive limits. Not only does the __ontology symbolized by a disc-world allow for each thing to exist in its own place, in a mosaic of myriad ontological alterities, it also understands that a thing can be expected to exist and to act only on the basis of its particular accesses to the levels of existence__, and of its own particular form and limits. Conversely, __the ontology symbolized by a spherical world__, which is typical of Technic’s cosmology, __denies any ontological plurality both within its own cosmos__ (all positions are ontologically equivalent to each other, as sections of the same all-encompassing series-system), __and also between its cosmos and anything outside of it__ (since no existence or presence is envisaged outside of the series-system itself, then no fundamental ontological alterity is possible)
<!-- This is such a fun idea. Although I'd say it's a big stretch xD -->

p60
A person still knows, hopes and believes to be ‘something’ rather than ‘nothing’. But such awareness has to face a reality-system (or better a system of unreality) in which autonomous existence as a subject is no longer possible.
<!-- Mahdude, autonomous existence was never an possible. What are you even talking about? xD -->

p62
What until recently was uncontroversially characterized as psychopathology, is now presented as a normal condition for a large part of contemporary humanity.
<!-- Oh no, is this queerphobia?.. I hope it's not queerphobia. -->

## Language and what it does ontologically
p74-75

we shall look at language through the lens of what language ‘does’, that is, what it produces when it is used. __Any time we put forward a linguistic statement__, every time we express a linguistic unit, __we are suggesting to our interlocutors that a certain figure (an object, property or relation) be admitted as legitimately present in the world. The interlocutors’ acceptance of our linguistic utterance as meaningful, grants legitimate presence in the word to the suggested figure__ – thus making it available to be employed in the larger game of linguistic exchange and recombination. __The same happens in a soliloquy or at the level of one’s conscious thinking__ – though the rapidity with which we accept our own linguistic proposal as plausibly present in the world, tends to obfuscate this questioning process. And of course, the same also applies to cases in which the utterer or interlocutor is not a human, but a machine.

In this sense, __language’s production is fundamentally ontological, consisting in a continuous negotiation on which figures could or should be included in the catalogue of the world.__ Every linguistic unit thus takes on the form of a candidature and of a proposition. Equally, the world becomes the negotiating table onto which the figures of our daily experience are alternatively granted or denied legitimate ontological status as ‘present’. In this sense, __language functions as a way to manage what entities make it onto the catalogue of the communicable and operable layer of reality.__

However, when language is taken absolutely, that is when it is unbound (ab-solutus) from any external constraint or from any other principle outside itself, the world that it creates suddenly becomes the only possible ontological field. __When language becomes absolute language, its cosmogony ceases to be just one possible way of looking at the world__ (namely, in terms of which figures have a legitimate presence in it, as communicable and operable items) __becoming instead an all-encompassing terrain. Outside of it, nothing is permitted; outside of negotiated linguistic ‘presence’, nothing is allowed, not even existence as it stands ineffably in itself.__ __Existence is substituted by presence__, and its stability is taken over by the negotiating process of language. Language creates the world in its own image, and when it becomes absolute, suddenly there is no longer anything outside the world.

The process of ontological negotiation that normally takes place at the level of language, now becomes fully internal to language itself; it is no longer an extra-linguistic interlocutor that accepts or rejects candidates to presence in the world, but __it is the very fabric of language that absorbs or rejects possible figures as they emerge from language itself.__ In the state in which it becomes absolute, language presents itself as supposedly uttered by no mouth; rather, it claims to be at once its own creator and creation.

p76

__Considered ontologically, truth’s reference tosomething ‘being the case’, takes the place of something simply ‘being’.__

p77-78

A series, understood in the context of an ontology of positions, is always fundamentally an articulation of the 1–0, ‘being or not the case’ sequence.

Within Technic’s equivalence between truth and representation, truth stands for the essence of language’s fundamental process of signification; what used to be the autonomous existence of things, is here degraded to a state of affairs that is entirely dependent on the sanction given to it by the series in which it is inserted.
<!-- Yeah, hmm, hmmm. How is it "degraded"? How is it a bad thing at all, mahdude? Autonomous existence of things is not a thing. Well, it is, but it's unattainable for us. There are things that cannot be perceived. And I don't even mean inherently ideological concepts like justice or love or whatever. Radiation is a thing. And like, yeah you have to make a representation of it that is then sanctioned by the bigger theoretical model to give it truthness. Existence isn't an easy concept. Didn't you write it somewhere a few pages ago yourself? -->

__At the same time, truth indicates how the precarious and subordinate state of things__ reduced to states of affairs, __is nonetheless the only possible form of presence__ in Technic’s world; the 1–0 series is a functional series, on the basis of the metaphysical axiom that there is indeed nothing else apart from that which can be reduced to its ‘being the case’ or ‘not being the case’.
<!-- I really don't think it's such a hegemony. The constructivism/objectivism debate goes on forever. Scientists know that they're using models which aren't complete representations of reality. Reduction is an important part of a model, you have to simplify the real to be able to make sense of it. -->

In brief, truth refers to the ontological transformation undergone by the existent as it is subsumed within absolute language, and thus within Technic’s cosmology.
<!-- But do we have anything else beside language to grasp the real? Like... I can't thing of anything. So Technic just accepts this limitation and doesn't care for what's outside of language, because there's little you can do with it. -->

A thing (inasmuch as it is an existent, rather than a purely linguistic construct or a state of affairs) exists not only in itself, but also in a specific ‘localization’.
<!-- *Laughs in Physics* -->

Even ideas, considered as immaterial ‘things’, exist autonomously not only in themselves, but also in a specific relationship with their emergence within reality as ‘that and that’ idea. __It is this combination between autonomous existence in itself, on the one hand, and the specific localization of an existent as ‘that’ existent, on the other, that makes things possible objects for subjects and vice versa.__

Conversely, once things have been turned into states of affairs, they are no longer endowed with existence in themselves, nor are they constrained by any other localization but their belonging to a series.
<!-- Wtf do you meeeean..... This sounds just like bullshit nitpicking. Is this localization not good enough? How does any other localization work, tell me. Have you heard of Heisenberg's uncertainly principle? There is _NO_ other localization. Also, 'things are no longer endowed with existence in themselves'? How comes? Why? WTF are you talking about?" -->

They have neither existence ‘in themselves’, nor any unique ‘that-ness’. This means that they can appear simultaneously in different locations, at the same time as part of different historical series referring to culture, economics and so on.
<!-- How does language work? xD Oh no, words can refer to different things simultaneously. Ffs, I hope I'm misunderstanding this massively. xD -->

In fact, they are merely their own simultaneous presence within multiple series, that is, they are nothing more than the simultaneous activation of positions in different series.
<!-- Ok, ok, so, I think your point is like 'what if we took language too seriously'. Right? Technic is 'language on steroids' that forgets about it being a language.  -->

The availability of the object of truth (i.e. a state of affairs that ‘is or not the case’) to feature simultaneously in several different locations or series, amounts to its ability to be re-presented infinitely. This form of infinite replicability, raised to the level of an ontological principle, does not refer to the case of an original being copied countless times, but rather to something being simultaneously present in a potentially infinite number of locations.
<!-- How is it a bad model? If anthing, this is a more rhizomatic model than the arbial model of 'original' thing that is copied. And I do like rhizomatic approach more. :3 -->

__this ability to be limitlessly re-presented is a specific and constitutive aspect of state of affairs within absolute language__, we can take it as __one of their defining ontological qualities__. Understood as such, representation has to do at the same time with the non-specificity and non-substantiality of the ‘stuff’ that makes up Technic’s cosmology, and with its availability to be replicated indefinitely, that is to be the object of production.
<!-- Nooooooo.... Phones baaaaad! xD Look, production is not inherently evil. What is condemned in the figure of simulacra is the state of free, oceanic differences! -->

Truth as representation and representation as truth, indicates an ontological scenario in which the ‘stuff’ that makes up the world is merely a ‘state of affairs’, at once devoid of autonomous existence, uniqueness and substantiality, and so radically un-situated at an ontological level as to be available for limitless reproduction – better, corresponding exactly to its own reproduction.
<!-- No, but still an interesting take. -->

p80

While absolute language insisted on the fact that anything wishing to claim legitimate presence in the world has to rely on its belonging to the structure of a series, measure adds that it also has to consider the series as its ultimate goal. __It is not enough that the ‘stuff’ of the world under Technic, has to mutate in order to be suitable to enter a series: it also has to understand the ever-expansion of its series as its overarching *ethical goal*.__ Measure, thus, inserts an ethical dimension within Technic’s cosmogony, setting the general direction for action in all subsequent hypostases. 
<!-- Hm, okay, that sounds like massively misunderstood scientific method, doesn't it? -->

p82

It is not a matter, as many well-meaning humanists have often repeated, that in our contemporary world things have been turned into numbers, rather both things and numbers have been reduced to one same type of __annihilating ontology__.

p92

Considered ontologically, __the nothingness that ‘I’ am,__ and my complete reduction to a set of instrumental units in a number of historical series of production, is here slightly mitigated by the provision of __a category into which ‘my’ nothingness can find a place__, however fictitious.

p93

Of course, the AGE is a __purely nominalistic construct__, in that it is little more than a name defining a specific pattern. Indeed, within Technic’s cosmology, __nothing makes the specific pattern that I call ‘myself’, more essentially appropriate than, say, another pattern that includes parts of myself, aspects of a cup, the level of ozone__ in the atmosphere and a number of moments from the Battle of Verdun.

p94

__for determinism to take place there should be at least a theoretical possibility for things to be different than they actually are__

Humans (or farmed animals, or waterfalls, etc.) are subjected to a condition of hyper-exploitation, stretching from traditional forms of work to the exploitation of our emotions, because __our very ontological position in the world is merely that of specific patterns of activities.__ We seem to have become nothing else but workers, because in Technic’s cosmology __we are nothing but work.__

There is no ghostly 1 per cent of the population that authentically enjoys all this, or truly benefits from it, or specifically wills for us to be enslaved – because technically there is nothing at all, except the ever-expansion of the series that composes Technic’s cosmology

p95-96

within the present world as ruled by Technic __there is no distinction between desire, activity, people and things__; none of these things exist, but they are all merely present as instances of activations of positions in series.

The very notion of desire, which in common parlance we still continue to attribute to ourselves, has to be interpreted in the light of Technic’s cosmogonic project. Since AGEs are not distinct from their productive activity, they are not different from what we usually call their ‘desire’. Desire for something, within Technic, is just the passage to a new activation in a different series. As I desire to buy a product, for example, I merely activate a new position in the consumer-series, specifically in the sub-series related to that product or service. This ever- growing expansion in the number of simultaneous activations, which we could call ‘infinite desire’, is, in fact, the very process through which Technic’s cosmogony unfolds. Within this perspective, __all types of desire are equal and equally legitimate__, since they all ultimately boil down to the same process, fulfilling the same, fundamental, cosmogonic function. 
__The only type of desire that finds no legitimacy__ here is, of course, that which __is__ entirely negative – a form of total __anhedonia that seeks no redemption or supplement.__

p96

Considered serially, time doesn’t quite exist, neither linearly nor cyclically. __Within the ever-expanding movement of purely abstract, linguistic series, time is just the rhythm of their expansion__; it runs after itself, and its only mode of presence is that of ‘lateness’. 

p97

Within Technic, moments and events are never temporally ‘present’, since their presence is only retrospectively confirmed by the act of their recording and broadcasting within the series of production.
<!-- Phones bad I guess xD -->

Nor are they ever truly ‘future’, since their potential presence is already, in itself, productive. Equally, they can never be said to be ‘past’, since their past activation of a position in a series remains always active as the foundation on which later instances of expansion take place. Rather, __every moment and event within Technic is defined temporally only as ‘late’, that is as ‘not fast enough’.__
<!-- Okay, okay, you got me here. This is an excellent phrase. -->

p100

The irreducible mystery of life, stubbornly escaping Technic’s capture, is converted into a theme park for Technic’s triumph. By resolving its resistance into a case of vulnerability – that is as endless possibility for resolution – life is turned into the stage for Technic’s denial of its own limits. 

The crumbling support that life as vulnerability offers to Technic’s unfolding, and which would eventually lead to Technic’s own demise, is __frozen in the very instant of its crumbling__; it is never a resolved situation, or a complete defeat.

p101

__If we understand mental illness merely as a lack of mental health, and if we consider health simply as a state of functional presence__ within the serial system of production, then we imply that it is exactly in the form of absolute language that we seek our redemption. 

p102

As the uppermost limit to Technic’s chain of emanations, we find a form of paradox that could be defined as the Ego Absconditus, the ‘hidden I’. We noticed how the first hypostasis and first principle of absolute language shuns any notion of situatedness or of external enunciation; __absolute language presents itself as a language spoken by no mouth, in no place or time.__ By abolishing the very possibility of anything existing outside of its own terrain, absolute language wishes to deny also its own origin as deriving from anywhere

p103

The idea of ‘absolute’ being, as it is commonly employed by philosophers, is not even an initial idea for them, for the passive participle ‘absolute’ presupposes an absolvens, an ‘absolution’ of being, liberating being by putting it not in the infinitive (esse), nor in the substantival participle (ens), but in the imperative (esto).
    H. Corbin, History of Islamic Philosophy, London and New York: Kegan Paul International, 1993, p. 354.

Regardless of how categorically absolute language states to be the product of its own enunciation, __as language it still requires a non-linguistic source in order to be able to emerge as a phenomenon__

# Intermission: What is reality?

### Understand existence and essence 
p111-112
We can __understand ‘existence’ and ‘essence’ as two limit-concepts__, that is, as the two opposite extremes of one same continuum. We can define this continuum in several different ways: for example, as the __continuum between ineffability and language__, or between __direct apprehension and rational categorization__, or again as the continuum between the __unthinkable and the thinkable__, or between the __unmeasurable__ substratum __and the measure__ of specific limits and so on. In each of these oppositions, we can position __‘existence’ as the limit-concept that tends towards the former pole__, while ‘essence’ as the limit-concept that tends towards the latter pole.

p113

__Reality is__ the space that is available to our existential experience of life in the world, oscillating between pure contemplation and pure activity, while never truly reaching either extreme pole.

p117

As we observed in the previous section on __Technic__, the present reality-system and its cosmological structure move towards a disintegration of reality, through the __annihilation of existence__ (by denying the very principle of existence in itself, as it stands ineffably beyond linguistic categorization) __and the hypertrophy of essence__ (pushed to its limit, to coincide as much as possible with the very principle of absolute language). What used to be the segment stretching between the fuzzy boundaries of existence and essence – that is, reality as such – is now reduced to a mere point, at once entirely coincident with pure essence and devoid of any existence. The frame collapses, and reality vanishes with it. 

Again, from an eminently human, existential position, this disintegration of reality bears significant and dramatic consequences. As we have seen, the cosmology of Technic brings human action and imagination to a state of paralysis: __a condition of constant and severe existential anxiety that forces every existent to consider themselves illegitimate impostors inasmuch as they exist.__ 

# Magic's comogony
p121
__As it is usually presented today – most notably in films and literature – magic amounts to little more than a set of spectacular technical skills__, reducible to the equivalent of as-yet undiscovered scientific advancements in the field of technology. Magic is thus considered as merely another, possibly more exotic way to exploit the world as a stockpiling of standing-reserves, which the magician is able to mobilize through his/her individual powers. As we shall see in the next and final chapter of this book, this understanding of magic is exactly opposite to that which characterized the late ancient practice of theurgy and, more generally, the tradition of ‘true magic’ spanning from late antiquity to the end of the Renaissance era.

... since its earliest definition as such, __magic has been bound to be understood as the shadow of whatever society knows and calls its own.__
