In simulacra, repetition already plays upon repetitions, and difference already plays upon differences. __Repetitions repeat themselves, while the differenciator differenciates itself. The task of life is to make all these repetitions coexist in a space in which difference is distributed.__


# Conclusion

p347

the __four iron collars of representation__: identity in the concept, opposition in the predicate, analogy in judgement and resemblance in perception. 

These are the four roots of the principle of reason: the identity of the concept which is reflected in a ratio cognoscendi; the opposition of the predicate which is developed in a ratio fiendi; the analogy of judgement which is distributed in a ratio essendi; and the resemblance of perception which determines a ratio agendi.

<!-- “ratio essendi” is what makes something what it is (mathematics)

“ratio cognoscendi” is the relation reason-consequence, applicable to logic (“it rains therefore the floor is wet”)

“ratio fiendi” is the causes (why something happens)

“ratio volendi” has to do with psychology which associates motivation-behaviour and justifies a certain individual behaviour of someone. (I _guess_ it's the same as ratio agendi.)-->

Every other difference, every difference which is not rooted in this way, is an unbounded, uncoordinated and inorganic difference: too large or too small, not only to be thought but to exist. Ceasing to be thought, difference is dissipated in non-being. From this, it is concluded that __difference in itself remains condemned and must atone or be redeemed__ under the auspices of a reason which renders it livable and thinkable, and makes it the object of an organic representation.

The greatest effort of philosophy was perhaps directed at rendering representation infinite (orgiastic).

allowing representation to conquer the obscure;

p348

__allowing [representation] to include the vanishing of difference which is too small and the dismemberment of difference which is too large;__

The ultimate wish of the organic is to become orgiastic and to conquer the in-itself

Leibniz's technique lies in the movement we call vice-diction: it consists in __constructing the essence from the inessential__, and conquering the finite by means of an infinite analytic identity

__difference remains subject to malediction__, and all that has happened is the discovery of more subtle and more sublime means to make it atone, or to redeem it and subject it to the categories of representation.

Hegelian contradiction appears to push difference to the limit, but this path is a dead end which brings it back to identity, __making identity the sufficient condition for difference to exist and be thought. It is only in relation to the identical, as a function of the identical, that contradiction is the greatest difference.__

p349

In short, __*representation* may well become infinite; it nevertheless does not acquire the power to affirm either divergence or decentring. It requires a convergent and *monocentric world*__: a world in 'which one is only apparently intoxicated, in which reason acts the drunkard and sings a Dionysian tune while none the less remaining 'pure' reason. The ground or sufficient reason is nothing but a means of allowing the identical to rule over infinity itself, and allowing the continuity of resemblance, the relation of analogy and the opposition of predicates to invade infinity.

This is the originality of sufficient reason: better to ensure the subjection of difference to the quadripartite yoke. The damage is done not only by the requirement of finite representation, which consists of fixing a propitious moment for difference, neither too large nor too small, in between excess and default; but also by the apparently contrary requirement of infinite representation, which purports to integrate the infinitely large and the infinitely small of difference, excess and default themselves. The entire alternative between finite and infinite applies very badly to difference, because it constitutes only an antinomy of representation.

p351

__What is condemned in the figure of simulacra is the state of free, oceanic differences__, of nomadic distributions and crowned anarchy, along with all that malice which challenges both the notion of the model and that of the copy.
<!-- Yay, no Baudrillard whining! -->

__Representation is a site of transcendental illusion.__ This illusion comes in several forms, four interrelated forms __which correspond particularly to thought, sensibility, the Idea and being.__

__These postulates culminate in the position of an identical thinking subject, which functions as a principle of identity for concepts in general.__

p352

__To restore difference in thought is to untie this first knot which consists of *representing difference through the identity* of the concept and the thinking subject.__

The second illusion concerns the __subordination of difference to resemblance__. ... The illusion takes the following form: difference necessarily tends to be cancelled in the quality which covers it, while at the same time inequality tends to be equalised within the extension in which it is distributed.

To restore difference within intensity as the being of the sensible is to untie the second knot, one which __subordinates difference to the similar within perception__, allowing it to be experienced only on condition that there is an assimilation of diversity taken as raw material for the identical concept.
<!-- Mmmm, i dunno if i can agree that difference is subordinated to the similar within perception. Quite the opposite, actually. You always notices the difference first, don't you? Or maybe not... Difference is seen as something "bad", whereas "similarity" is generally something "good". Though I can immediately bring a counter example to this. Like individuality is something good, and being "mediocre" is something bad.  -->

p353

The third illusion concerns the negative and the manner in which it subordinates difference to itself, in the form of both limitation and opposition.

p355

History progresses not by negation and the negation of negation, but by deciding problems and affirming differences.

To restore the differential in the Idea, and difference to the affirmation which flows from it, is to break this unholy bond which __subordinates difference to the negative__.

p356

Finally, the __fourth illusion concerns the subordination of difference to the analogy of judgement__.

difference is assigned two limits, in the form of two irreducible but complementary figures which indicate precisely its belonging to representation (the Large and the Small): the categories as a priori concepts and the empirical concepts; the originary determinable concepts and the derived determined concepts; the analogous and the opposed; the large genera and the species. This distribution of difference in a manner entirely dependent upon the requirements of representation essentially belongs within the analogical vision of the world. ... In terms of this distribution, __the individual is only, and only' understood as, that which bears differences in general, while Being distributes itself among the fixed forms of these differences__ and is said analogically of that which is.
