# The Tragic

p1
__Evaluations__, in essence, __are__ not values but __ways of being__, modes of existence of those who judge and evaluate, serving as principles for the values on the basis of which
they judge.


p3
__Critique is not a re-action of re-sentiment but the active expression of an active mode of existence; attack and not revenge, the natural aggression of a way of being,__ the divine wickedness without which perfection could not be imagined (EH 16-7). This way of being is that of the philosopher precisely because he intends to wield the differential element as critic and creator and therefore as a hammer. 

p3

All force is appropriation, domination, exploitation of a quantity of reality. Even __perception__, in its divers aspects, __is the expression of forces which appropriate nature.__

p3-4
__Sense__ is therefore a complex notion; there is always a plurality of senses, a constellation, a complex of successions but also of coexistences which make interpretation an art. "All subjugation, all domination amounts to a new interpretation."
[...]
There is no event, no phenomenon, word or thought which does not have a multiple sense. A thing is sometimes this, sometimes that, sometimes something more complicated-depending on the forces (the gods) which take possession of it.

p4

__religion does not have a unique sense,__ it serves many forces.

p6

Genealogy does not only interpret, it also evaluates. Up to now we have presented things as if different forces struggled over and took successive possession of an almost inert object. But __the object itself is force, expression of a force__. This is why there is more or less affinity between the object and the force which takes possession of it. __There is no object (phenomenon) which is not already possessed__ since in itself it is not an appearance but the apparition of a force.

p7

For __the will__ is not exercised mysteriously on muscles or nerves, still less on "matter in general", but __is necessarily exercised on another will.__ The real problem is not that of the relation of will to the involuntary but rather of the relation of a will that commands to a will that obeys - that obeys to a greater or lesser extent.

__The will is called a complex thing because insofar as it wills it wills obedience - but only a will can obey commands.__

__"In all willing it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on the basis of a social structure composed of many 'souls'"__ (BGE 19 p. 31) When Nietzsche praises egoism it is always in an aggressive or polemical way, against the virtues, against the virtue of disinterestedness (Z III "Of the Three Evil Things"). __But__ in fact __egoism is a bad interpretation of will, just as atomism is a bad interpretation of force.__ In order for there to be egoism it is necessary for there to be an ego. What directs us towards the origin is the fact that __every force is related to another, whether in order to command or to obey.__ The origin is the difference in the origin, difference in the origin is hierarchy, that is to say the relation of a dominant to a dominated force, of an obeyed to an obeying will.

p8

__Life struggles with another kind of life.__ Pluralism sometimes appears to be dialectical - but it is its most ferocious enemy, its
only profound enemy.

In Nietzsche __the essential relation of one force to another is never conceived of as a negative element__ in the essence. In its relation with the other __the force which makes itself obeyed does not deny the other or that which it is not, it affirms its own difference and *enjoys* this difference.__

p9

__The negate is not present in the essence__ as that from which force draws its activity: on the contrary __it is a result of activity__, of the existence of an active force and the affirmation of its difference.

As for the negative concept (that is to say, __negation as a concept__) "it __is only a subsequently-invented pale contrasting image in relation to its positive basic concept__ - filled with life and passion through and through" (GM 110 p. 37).

__For the speculative element of negation, opposition or contradiction Nietzsche substitutes the practical element of difference, the object of affirmation and enjoyment.__

The question which Nietzsche constantly repeats, "what does a will want, what does this one or that one want?", must not be understood as the search for a goal, a motive or an object for this will. __What a will wants is to affirm its difference.__ In its essential relation with the "other" a will makes its difference an object of affirmation.

Furthermore, we must ask what does the dialectician himself want?
__What does this will which wills the dialectic want? It is an exhausted force which does not have the strength to affirm its difference, a force which no longer acts but rather reacts to the forces which dominate it__ - only such a force brings to the foreground the negative element in its relation to the other. Such a force __denies all that it is not and makes this negation its own essence__ and the principle of its existence. "While every noble morality develops from a triumphant affirmation of itself, slave morality from the outset says No to what is 'outside', what is 'different' what is 'not itself and this No is its creative deed" (GM110 p. 36).

p10

This is why Nietzsche presents __the dialectic__ as the speculation of the pleb, as __the way of thinking of the slave__: __the abstract thought of contradiction then prevails over the concrete feeling of positive difference, reaction over action, *revenge and ressentiment take the place of aggression*.__

Moreover the __relation of master and slave is not, in itself, dialectical__. Who is the dialectician, who dialectises the relationship? It is the slave, the __slave's perspective__, the way of thinking belonging to the slave's perspective. __The famous dialectical aspect of the master-slave relationship depends on the fact that power is conceived not as will to power but as representation of power__, representation of superiority, recognition by "the one" of the superiority of "the other". 


What the wills in Hegel want is to have their power recognised,
to represent their power. According to Nietzsche we have here a __wholly erroneous conception of the will to power__ and its nature. This is the slave's conception, it is the image that the man of ressentiment has of power. __The slave only conceives of power as the object of a recognition, the content of a representation, the stake in a competition,__ and therefore makes it depend, at the end of a fight, on a simple attribution of established values.

...__the portrait of the master that Hegel offers us is, from the start, a portrait which represents the slave, at least as he is in his dreams, as at best a successful slave.__ Underneath the Hegelian image of the master we always find the slave.

p13

In the Birth of Tragedy __the tragic in its totality is thus defined as original contradiction__, its Dionysian solution and the dramatic expression of this solution. It is characteristic of tragic culture and its modern representatives - Kant, Schopenhauer and Wagner - to reproduce and resolve the contradiction, to resolve it in reproducing it, to resolve it on the original basis. "Its most important characteristic is that __wisdom takes the place of science as the highest end__ - wisdom that, uninfluenced by the seductive distractions of the sciences, __turns with unmoved eyes to a comprehensive view of the world and seeks to grasp, with sympathetic feelings of love, the eternal suffering as its own__" (BT 18 p. 112). 

    p12
    Dionysus and Apollo are therefore not opposed as the terms of a contradiction but rather as two antithetical ways of resolving it; Apollo mediately, in the contemplation of the plastic image, Dionysus immediately in the reproduction, in the musical symbol of the will.

p14

__Dionysus__ is insistently presented as the _affirmative and affirming_ god. He is __not content with "resolving" pain in a higher and suprapersonal pleasure__ but rather __he affirms it and turns it into someone's pleasure__. This is why Dionysus is himself transformed in multiple affirmations, rather than being dissolved in original being or reabsorbing multiplicity into primeval depths. __He affirms the pains of growth rather than reproducing the sufferings of individuation. He is the god who affirms life, for whom life must be affirmed, but not justified or redeemed.__

p 15

For Christianity the fact of suffering in __life__ means primarily that life is not just, that it is even essentially unjust, that it pays for an essential injustice by suffering, it __is blameworthy because it suffers__. __The result of this is that life must be justified__, that is to say, redeemed of its injustice or saved. __Saved by that suffering__ which a little while ago accused it: it must suffer since it is blameworthy.

These two aspects of Christianity form what Nietzsche calls "bad conscience" or the internalization of pain (GMII). 

They define truly Christian nihilism, that is to say the way in which __Christianity denies life__; on the one side the __machine for manufacturing guilt__, the horrible pain-punishment equation, on the other side the machine to multiply pain, the justification by pain, the dark workshop.

Even when Christianity sings the praises of love and life what curses there are in these songs, what hatred beneath this love! __It loves life like the bird of prey loves the lamb; tender, mutilated and dying.__ The dialectician posits Christian love as an antithesis, for example as the antithesis of Judaic hatred. But it is the profession and mission of the dialectician to establish antitheses everywhere where there are more delicate evaluations to be made, coordinations to be interpreted. That the flower is the antithesis of the leaf, that it "refutes" the leaf - this is a celebrated discovery dear to the dialectic. This is also the way in which the flower of Christian love "refutes" hate - that is to say, in an entirely fictitious manner. "One should not imagine that love . . . grew up . . . as the opposite of Jewish hatred! No, the reverse is true! That love grew out of it as its crown, as its triumphant crown spreading itself farther and farther into the purest brightness and sunlight, driven as it were into the domain of light and the heights in the pursuit of the goals of that hatred-victory, spoil and seduction" (GM 18 p. 35*).

__How different this aspect is from the true Dionysus!__ The Dionysus of the Birth of Tragedy still "resolved" pain, the joy that he experienced was still the joy of resolving it and also of bearing this resolution in the primeval unity. But now Dionysus has seized the sense and value of his own transformations, he is the god for whom __life does not have to be justified__, for whom life is essentially just. 

Moreover it is life which takes charge of justification, "it affirms even the harshest suffering" (VP IV 464). We must be clear, it does __not resolve pain by internalising it, it affirms it in the element of its exteriority__. And, from this, the opposition of Dionysus and Christ is developed point by point as that of the affirmation of life (its extreme valuation) and the negation of life (its extreme depreciation). 

p16

...there are __two kinds of suffering and sufferers__. 

__"Those who suffer from the superabundance of life"__ make suffering an affirmation in the same way as they make intoxication an activity; in the laceration of Dionysus they recognise the extreme form of affirmation, with no possibility of subtraction, exception or choice.

__"Those who suffer__, on the contrary, __from an impoverishment of life"__ make intoxication a convulsion, a numbness; they make suffering a means of accusing life, of contradicting it and also a means of justifying life, of resolving the contradiction.

there is no more beautiful __saviour__ than the one __who would be__ simultaneously __executioner, victim and comforter__, the Holy Trinity, the wonderful dream of bad conscience.

From the point of view of a saviour, "life must be the path which leads to sainthood". From the point of view of Dionysus, __"existence seems holy enough by itself to justify a further immensity of suffering"__ (VP IV 464).

p17

Dionysus affirms all that appears, "even the most bitter suffering", and appears in all that is affirmed.

__Multiple and pluralist affirmation__ - this is the essence of the tragic. 
... We must find, for each thing in turn, the special means by which it is affirmed, by which it ceases to be negative.

What __defines the tragic is the joy of multiplicity, plural joy__. This joy is not the result of a sublimation, a purging, a compensation, a resignation or a reQQtt'Cili&tion.
...
__tragedy as an aesthetic phenomenon__. The __tragic is the aesthetic form of joy, not a medical phrase or a moral solution to pain, fear or pity.__ 

__It is joy that is tragic.__ But this means that tragedy is immediately joyful, that it only calls forth the fear and pity of the obtuse spectator, __the pathological and moralising listener__ who counts on it to ensure the proper functioning of his moral sublimations and medical purgings.

And indeed, a true renaissance is needed in order to __liberate the tragic from all the fear or pity of__ the bad listeners who gave it a mediocre sense born of __bad conscience__.

p19

A god was needed to __interpret existence__. It was __necessary to accuse life in order to redeem it, to redeem it in order to justify it.__ Existence was evaluated but __always from the standpoint of bad conscience.__

As we have seen suffering was used as a way of proving the injustice of __existence__, but at the same time as a way of finding a higher and divine justification for it. (__It is blameworthy because it suffers, but because it suffers it is atoned for and redeemed.__)

The Greeks themselves interpreted and evaluated __existence as excess.__

p20

But he only had to discover the true Dionysus in order to see the __trap__ it hides or the end it served: it made __existence a moral and religious phenomenon__! Existence seems to be given so much by being made a crime, an excess. It gains a double nature - an immense injustice and a justifying atonement. It is Titanised by crime, it is made divine by the expiation of crime. And what is there at the end of all this if not a __subtle way of depreciating existence__, of __subjecting it to judgment__, __moral judgment__ and above all __God's judgment__?

p21

"Everywhere where __responsibilities__ have been sought it is the instinct of __revenge__ that __has sought them__. This instinct of __revenge__ has gained such a hold on humanity through the centuries that __all of metaphysics, psychology, history and above all morality bear its imprint__. As soon as man began thinking he introduced the bacillus of revenge into things" (VP III 458).

"I wished to conquer the feeling of a full irresponsibility, to __make myself independent of praise and blame__, of present and past" (VP III 383, 465). __Irresponsibility - Nietzsche's most noble and beautiful secret.__

When the Greeks spoke of __existence as criminal and "hubric" they thought that the gods had driven men mad__; existence is blameworthy but it is the __gods who take upon themselves the responsibility for the fault__. This is the __great difference between__ the Greek interpretation of __crime__ and the Christian interpretation of __sin__. "'Foolishness', 'folly', a little 'disturbance in the head', this much even the Greeks of the strongest, bravest age conceded of themselves as __the reason for much that was bad__ and calamitous - __foolishness, not sin!__ ... 'He must have been deluded by a god' they concluded finally, shaking their heads . . . In this way the __gods__ served in those days to justify man to a certain extent even in his wickedness, they served as originators of evil - in those days they __took upon themselves not the punishment but__, what is nobler, __the guilt__." (GM II 23 p. 94).

p26

The __dice__ which are thrown once are the __affirmation of chance__, the combination which they form on falling is the affirmation of necessity. __Necessity is affirmed of chance in exactly the sense that being is affirmed of becoming and unity is affirmed of multiplicity.__

just as __unity does not suppress or deny multiplicity__, __necessity does not suppress or abolish chance__. Nietzsche identifies chance with multiplicity, with fragments, with parts, with chaos: the chaos of the dice that are shaken and then thrown. Nietzsche __turns chance into an affirmation.__

p31

From the pluralist standpoint a sense is referred to __the differential element__ from which its significance is derived, just as values are referred to the differential element from which their value is derived. This element which __is always present__, but also always implicit and hidden in the poem or aphorism __is like the second dimension of sense and values.__ __It is by developing this element and by developing itself in it that philosophy__ in its essential relation with the poem and the aphorism __constitutes complete interpretation and evaluation__, that is to say, __the art of thinking__, faculty of thought or "faculty of rumination" (GM Preface 8 p. 23).

__Rumination and eternal return__: two stomachs are not too many for thinking.

p32

__To think is to send out a dicethrow.__ Only a dicethrow, on the basis of chance, could affirm necessity and produce "the unique number which cannot be another".

The dice which fall are a constellation, their points form the number "born of the stars". The table of the dicethrow is therefore double, sea of chance and sky of necessity, midnight-midday.

Not only is the __throwing of the dice__ an __unreasonable and irrational, absurd and superhuman__ act, but it constitutes the tragic attempt and __the tragic thought par excellence__.

__The number-constellation is, or could be, the book, the work of art as outcome__ and justification __of the world.__

p33 

The dicethrow is nothing when detached from innocence and the affirmation of chance. __The dicethrow is nothing if chance and necessity are opposed in it.__

p34

Nietzsche calls __the enterprise of denying life and depreciating existence nihilism.__ He analyses the principal forms of nihilism, ressentiment, bad conscience, ascetic ideal; the whole of nihilism and its forms he calls the spirit of revenge. But, the different forms of nihilism are __not at all reducible to psychological determinations, historical events or ideological currents, not even to metaphysical structures.__

The spirit of revenge is undoubtedly expressed biologically, psychologically, historically and metaphysically; the spirit of revenge is a type, it is not separable from a typology, the key stone of Nietzschean philosophy.

__Ressentiment is not part of psychology but the whole of our psychology, without knowing it, is a part of ressentiment.__

when Nietzsche undertakes the critique of nihilism he makes __nihilism the presupposition of all metaphysics__ rather than the expression of particular metaphysics: __there is no metaphysics which does not judge and depreciate life in the name of a supra-sensible world.__

We cannot even say that nihilism and its forms are categories of thought, for __the categories of thought, of reasonable thought - identity, causality, finality - themselves presuppose an interpretation of force which is that of ressentiment.__ 

"__The instinct of revenge__ has gained such a hold on humanity over the centuries that the __whole of metaphysics, psychology, history and above all morality bear its imprint.__ As soon as man began thinking he  introduced the bacillus of revenge into things" (VP III 458).

p35

__For a long time we have only been able to think in terms of ressentiment and bad conscience.__ We have had no other ideal but the ascetic ideal. We have opposed knowledge to life in order to judge life, in order to make it something blameworthy, responsible or erroneous. __We turned will into something bad, something stricken by a basic contradiction: we have said that it must be rectified, restrained, limited and even denied and suppressed.__

p36

"It is not necessary to wait", Nietzsche says, "for unhappiness, as those who make philosophy derive from dissatisfaction think. __It is in happiness that one must begin, in full virile maturity, in the fire of this burning joy which is that of the adult and victorious age__" (PTG 1).
<!-- The myth of the "happy childhood". We start from unhappiness. -->

# Active and Reactive

p39

__Spinoza__ suggested a new direction for the sciences and philosophy. He said that __we do not even know what a body can do, we talk about consciousness and spirit and chatter on about it all, but we do not know what a body is capable of, what forces belong to it or what they are preparing for__. Nietzsche knew that the hour had come, "We are in the phase of modesty of consciousness" (VP II 261/WP 676).

However, __consciousness is defined less__ in relation to exteriority (__in terms of the real__) __than__ in relation to superiority (__in terms of values__).

"Consciousness usually only appears when a whole wants to subordinate itself to a superior whole . . . Consciousness is born in relation to a being of which we could be a function" (VP II227). This is the servility of  consciousness; it merely testifies to the "formation of a superior body".

p40 

__There is no quantity of reality, all reality is already quantity of force.__

Inferior forces do not, by obeying, cease to be forces distinct from those which command. Obeying is a quality of force as such and relates to power just as much as commanding does: "__individual power is by no means surrendered.__ In the same way, _there is in commanding an admission that the absolute power of the opponent has not been vanquished, incorporated, disintegrated._ __'Obedience' and 'commanding' [both] are forms of struggle.__" (VP II 91/WP 642) 

p42

_The idea that science must follow in the footsteps of consciousness_, in the same directions, _is absurd._ We can sense _the morality in this idea_. In fact there can only be science where there is no consciousness, where there can be no consciousness.


p47

By persisting in demanding how becoming could have started and why it has not yet finished, the philosophers of antiquity are __false__ tragics, __invoking hubris, crime and punishment__.

p51

it is through will to power that [a force] obeys

p54

__Affirming and denying, appreciating and depreciating, express the will to power just as acting and reacting express force__. (And just as reactive forces are still forces, the will to deny, nihilism, is still will to power: " . . . a will to nothingness, an aversion to life, a rebellion against the most fundamental presuppositions of life; but it is and remains a will!" GM III 28 p. 163)

There is a deep affinity, a complicity, but never a confusion, between action and affirmation, between reaction and negation.

On the one hand, it is clear that there is __affirmation in every action__ and __negation in every reaction__. But, on the other hand, __action and reaction are__ more like means, __means or instruments of the will to power which affirms and denies__, just as reactive forces are instruments of nihilism.

Affirmation is not action but the power of becoming active, becoming active personified. Negation is not simple reaction but a becoming reactive.

p57

"vile", "ignoble" and "slave" comes from - these words designate the state of reactive forces that place themselves on high and entice active force into a trap, __replacing masters with slaves who do not stop being slaves.__

p58

active forces are the superior, dominant and strongest forces. But inferior forces can prevail without ceasing to be inferior in quantity and reactive in quality, without ceasing to be slaves in this sense. One of the finest remarks in The Will to Power is: "__The strong always have to be defended against the weak__" (VP I 395).

Everything that separates a force from what it can do he calls law. __Law__, in this sense, __expresses the triumph of the weak over the strong.__ Nietzsche adds: the triumph of reaction over action.

The slave does not stop being a slave by being triumphant; when the weak triumph it is not by forming a greater force but by separating force from what it can do.

p59

How can he explain to Socrates that __"desire" is not the association of a pleasure and a pain__, the pain of  experiencing it and the pleasure of satisfying it? How can he explain that __pleasure and pain are reactions, properties of reactive forces, the proof of adaptation or lack of it__? And how can Socrates be made to understand that __the weak do not form a stronger force__? Socrates has partially misunderstood and partially misheard - he is too full of dialectical ressentiment and the spirit of revenge.

Nietzsche also encounters his own Socrates. These are the free thinkers. They say: "What are you complaining about? How could the weak have triumphed if they did not form superior force?" "Let us bow down before accomplished fact" (GM I 9). This is __modern positivism__. They claim to carry out the __critique of values__, they claim to __refuse all appeals to transcendent values__, they declare them unfashionable, but only in order to rediscover them as the force which run the world of today. The value of Church, morality, State etc. is only discussed so that their human force and content can be admired.

p60

__The free thinker__ wants to recover the content of religion but never considers that __religion__ might in fact __contain man's basest forces__, forces which we might want to leave behind. This is why we can have no confidence in the free thinker's atheism, even when he's a democrat and a socialist: "__It is the church, and not its poison that repels us__" (GM I 9 p. 36). The essential characteristics of the free thinker's positivism and humanism are fatalism, interpretative impotence and ignorance of the qualities of force.

__the fact is always something used by the weak against the strong__; "the fact is __always stupid__, having at all times resembled a calf rather than a god" (UM II "Use and Abuse of History" 8)

"There are no facts, nothing but interpretations" (VP II 133)

p61

__Strength or weakness__ cannot be judged by taking the result and success of struggle as a criterion.

p62

__will to power is manifested as a capacity for being affected.__ This capacity is not an abstract possibility, it is necessarily fulfilled and actualised at each moment by the other forces to which a given force relates.

__The more ways a body could be affected the more force it had.__

the __capacity for being affected is__ not necessarily a passivity but an affectivity, a sensibility, a sensation.

"The will to power is not a being not a becoming, but a pathos" (VP II 311/WP 635)

p63

"The fact is that __the will to power rules even in the inorganic world__, or rather that there is no inorganic world. __Action at a distance cannot be eliminated, for one thing attracts another and a thing feels itself attracted.__ This is the fundamental fact. . .In order for the will to power to be able to manifest itself it needs to perceive the things it sees and feel the approach of what is assimilable to it" (VP II 89).

The effects of force are active insofar as the __force appropriates anything that resists it__ and compels the obedience of inferior force.

Again, __obeying is a manifestation of the will to power__.

not only do __disintegration, division and separation always express will to power__ but so do being disintegrated, being separated and being divided: "Division appears as the consequence of the will to power" (VP II73).

All __sensibility is only a becoming of forces__.

p65

shepherd "writhing, choking, convulsed, his face  distorted", a heavy black snake hanging out of his mouth (Z III "Of the Vision and the Riddle" p. 180). Later, Zarathustra himself explains the vision: "The great disgust at man - it choked me and had crept into my throat. . .

. . .And eternal return, even for the smallest - that was my __disgust__ at all existence! Ah, disgust! Disgust! Disgust!" (Z III "The Convalescent" pp. 235-6).

In order to affirm the eternal return it is necessary to bite off and spit out the snake's head. Then the shepherd is no longer either man or shepherd, "he was transformed, surrounded with light, he was laughing! Never yet on earth had any man laughed as he laughed" (Z III "Of the Vision and the Riddle" p. 80*). Another becoming, another sensibility: the Overman.
<!-- Becoming the Overman is to get rid of disgust. -->

p66

A __reactive force__ can certainly be considered from different points of view. Illness for example . . . __They separate us from our power but at the same time they give us another power, "dangerous" and "interesting".__ They bring us __new feelings and teach us new ways of being affected__. There is something __admirable__ in the becoming-reactive of forces, admirable and dangerous. Not only the sick man, but even the religious man present this double aspect: reactive on the one hand, possessing a new power on the other. "Human history would be altogether too stupid a thing without the spirit that the impotent have introduced into it" (GM I 7 p. 33). 

p67

_There are reactive forces that become grandiose and fascinating by following the will to nothingness and there are active forces that subside because they do not know how to follow the powers of affirmation._
