# Critique
p3
__Critique is not a re-action of re-sentiment but the active expression of an active mode of existence; attack and not revenge, the natural aggression of a way of being,__ the divine wickedness without which perfection could not be imagined (EH 16-7). This way of being is that of the philosopher precisely because he intends to wield the differential element as critic and creator and therefore as a hammer.
