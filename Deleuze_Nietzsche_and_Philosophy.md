__Evaluations__, in essence, __are__ not values but __ways of being__, modes of existence of those who judge and evaluate, serving as principles for the values on the basis of which
they judge.


p3
__Critique is not a re-action of re-sentiment but the active expression of an active mode of existence; attack and not revenge, the natural aggression of a way of being,__ the divine wickedness without which perfection could not be imagined (EH 16-7). This way of being is that of the philosopher precisely because he intends to wield the differential element as critic and creator and therefore as a hammer. 

p3

All force is appropriation, domination, exploitation of a quantity of reality. Even __perception__, in its divers aspects, __is the expression of forces which appropriate nature.__

p3-4
__Sense__ is therefore a complex notion; there is always a plurality of senses, a constellation, a complex of successions but also of coexistences which make interpretation an art. "All subjugation, all domination amounts to a new interpretation."
[...]
There is no event, no phenomenon, word or thought which does not have a multiple sense. A thing is sometimes this, sometimes that, sometimes something more complicated-depending on the forces (the gods) which take possession of it.

p4

__religion does not have a unique sense,__ it serves many forces.

p6

Genealogy does not only interpret, it also evaluates. Up to now we have presented things as if different forces struggled over and took successive possession of an almost inert object. But __the object itself is force, expression of a force__. This is why there is more or less affinity between the object and the force which takes possession of it. __There is no object (phenomenon) which is not already possessed__ since in itself it is not an appearance but the apparition of a force.

p7

For __the will__ is not exercised mysteriously on muscles or nerves, still less on "matter in general", but __is necessarily exercised on another will.__ The real problem is not that of the relation of will to the involuntary but rather of the relation of a will that commands to a will that obeys - that obeys to a greater or lesser extent.

__The will is called a complex thing because insofar as it wills it wills obedience - but only a will can obey commands.__

__"In all willing it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on the basis of a social structure composed of many 'souls'"__ (BGE 19 p. 31) When Nietzsche praises egoism it is always in an aggressive or polemical way, against the virtues, against the virtue of disinterestedness (Z III "Of the Three Evil Things"). __But__ in fact __egoism is a bad interpretation of will, just as atomism is a bad interpretation of force.__ In order for there to be egoism it is necessary for there to be an ego. What directs us towards the origin is the fact that __every force is related to another, whether in order to command or to obey.__ The origin is the difference in the origin, difference in the origin is hierarchy, that is to say the relation of a dominant to a dominated force, of an obeyed to an obeying will.

p8

__Life struggles with another kind of life.__ Pluralism sometimes appears to be dialectical - but it is its most ferocious enemy, its
only profound enemy.

In Nietzsche __the essential relation of one force to another is never conceived of as a negative element__ in the essence. In its relation with the other __the force which makes itself obeyed does not deny the other or that which it is not, it affirms its own difference and *enjoys* this difference.__

p9

__The negate is not present in the essence__ as that from which force draws its activity: on the contrary __it is a result of activity__, of the existence of an active force and the affirmation of its difference.

As for the negative concept (that is to say, __negation as a concept__) "it __is only a subsequently-invented pale contrasting image in relation to its positive basic concept__ - filled with life and passion through and through" (GM 110 p. 37).

__For the speculative element of negation, opposition or contradiction Nietzsche substitutes the practical element of difference, the object of affirmation and enjoyment.__

The question which Nietzsche constantly repeats, "what does a will want, what does this one or that one want?", must not be understood as the search for a goal, a motive or an object for this will. __What a will wants is to affirm its difference.__ In its essential relation with the "other" a will makes its difference an object of affirmation.

Furthermore, we must ask what does the dialectician himself want?
__What does this will which wills the dialectic want? It is an exhausted force which does not have the strength to affirm its difference, a force which no longer acts but rather reacts to the forces which dominate it__ - only such a force brings to the foreground the negative element in its relation to the other. Such a force __denies all that it is not and makes this negation its own essence__ and the principle of its existence. "While every noble morality develops from a triumphant affirmation of itself, slave morality from the outset says No to what is 'outside', what is 'different' what is 'not itself and this No is its creative deed" (GM110 p. 36).

p10

This is why Nietzsche presents __the dialectic__ as the speculation of the pleb, as __the way of thinking of the slave__: __the abstract thought of contradiction then prevails over the concrete feeling of positive difference, reaction over action, *revenge and ressentiment take the place of aggression*.__

Moreover the __relation of master and slave is not, in itself, dialectical__. Who is the dialectician, who dialectises the relationship? It is the slave, the __slave's perspective__, the way of thinking belonging to the slave's perspective. __The famous dialectical aspect of the master-slave relationship depends on the fact that power is conceived not as will to power but as representation of power__, representation of superiority, recognition by "the one" of the superiority of "the other". 


What the wills in Hegel want is to have their power recognised,
to represent their power. According to Nietzsche we have here a __wholly erroneous conception of the will to power__ and its nature. This is the slave's conception, it is the image that the man of ressentiment has of power. __The slave only conceives of power as the object of a recognition, the content of a representation, the stake in a competition,__ and therefore makes it depend, at the end of a fight, on a simple attribution of established values.

...__the portrait of the master that Hegel offers us is, from the start, a portrait which represents the slave, at least as he is in his dreams, as at best a successful slave.__ Underneath the Hegelian image of the master we always find the slave.

p13

In the Birth of Tragedy __the tragic in its totality is thus defined as original contradiction__, its Dionysian solution and the dramatic expression of this solution. It is characteristic of tragic culture and its modern representatives - Kant, Schopenhauer and Wagner - to reproduce and resolve the contradiction, to resolve it in reproducing it, to resolve it on the original basis. "Its most important characteristic is that __wisdom takes the place of science as the highest end__ - wisdom that, uninfluenced by the seductive distractions of the sciences, __turns with unmoved eyes to a comprehensive view of the world and seeks to grasp, with sympathetic feelings of love, the eternal suffering as its own__" (BT 18 p. 112). 

    p12
    Dionysus and Apollo are therefore not opposed as the terms of a contradiction but rather as two antithetical ways of resolving it; Apollo mediately, in the contemplation of the plastic image, Dionysus immediately in the reproduction, in the musical symbol of the will.

p14

__Dionysus__ is insistently presented as the _affirmative and affirming_ god. He is __not content with "resolving" pain in a higher and suprapersonal pleasure__ but rather __he affirms it and turns it into someone's pleasure__. This is why Dionysus is himself transformed in multiple affirmations, rather than being dissolved in original being or reabsorbing multiplicity into primeval depths. __He affirms the pains of growth rather than reproducing the sufferings of individuation. He is the god who affirms life, for whom life must be affirmed, but not justified or redeemed.__

p 15

For Christianity the fact of suffering in __life__ means primarily that life is not just, that it is even essentially unjust, that it pays for an essential injustice by suffering, it __is blameworthy because it suffers__. __The result of this is that life must be justified__, that is to say, redeemed of its injustice or saved. __Saved by that suffering__ which a little while ago accused it: it must suffer since it is blameworthy.

These two aspects of Christianity form what Nietzsche calls "bad conscience" or the internalization of pain (GMII). 

They define truly Christian nihilism, that is to say the way in which __Christianity denies life__; on the one side the __machine for manufacturing guilt__, the horrible pain-punishment equation, on the other side the machine to multiply pain, the justification by pain, the dark workshop.

Even when Christianity sings the praises of love and life what curses there are in these songs, what hatred beneath this love! __It loves life like the bird of prey loves the lamb; tender, mutilated and dying.__ The dialectician posits Christian love as an antithesis, for example as the antithesis of Judaic hatred. But it is the profession and mission of the dialectician to establish antitheses everywhere where there are more delicate evaluations to be made, coordinations to be interpreted. That the flower is the antithesis of the leaf, that it "refutes" the leaf - this is a celebrated discovery dear to the dialectic. This is also the way in which the flower of Christian love "refutes" hate - that is to say, in an entirely fictitious manner. "One should not imagine that love . . . grew up . . . as the opposite of Jewish hatred! No, the reverse is true! That love grew out of it as its crown, as its triumphant crown spreading itself farther and farther into the purest brightness and sunlight, driven as it were into the domain of light and the heights in the pursuit of the goals of that hatred-victory, spoil and seduction" (GM 18 p. 35*).

__How different this aspect is from the true Dionysus!__ The Dionysus of the Birth of Tragedy still "resolved" pain, the joy that he experienced was still the joy of resolving it and also of bearing this resolution in the primeval unity. But now Dionysus has seized the sense and value of his own transformations, he is the god for whom __life does not have to be justified__, for whom life is essentially just. 

Moreover it is life which takes charge of justification, "it affirms even the harshest suffering" (VP IV 464). We must be clear, it does __not resolve pain by internalising it, it affirms it in the element of its exteriority__. And, from this, the opposition of Dionysus and Christ is developed point by point as that of the affirmation of life (its extreme valuation) and the negation of life (its extreme depreciation). 

p16

...there are __two kinds of suffering and sufferers__. 

__"Those who suffer from the superabundance of life"__ make suffering an affirmation in the same way as they make intoxication an activity; in the laceration of Dionysus they recognise the extreme form of affirmation, with no possibility of subtraction, exception or choice.

__"Those who suffer__, on the contrary, __from an impoverishment of life"__ make intoxication a convulsion, a numbness; they make suffering a means of accusing life, of contradicting it and also a means of justifying life, of resolving the contradiction.

there is no more beautiful __saviour__ than the one __who would be__ simultaneously __executioner, victim and comforter__, the Holy Trinity, the wonderful dream of bad conscience.

From the point of view of a saviour, "life must be the path which leads to sainthood". From the point of view of Dionysus, __"existence seems holy enough by itself to justify a further immensity of suffering"__ (VP IV 464).

p17

Dionysus affirms all that appears, "even the most bitter suffering", and appears in all that is affirmed.

__Multiple and pluralist affirmation__ - this is the essence of the tragic. 
... We must find, for each thing in turn, the special means by which it is affirmed, by which it ceases to be negative.

What __defines the tragic is the joy of multiplicity, plural joy__. This joy is not the result of a sublimation, a purging, a compensation, a resignation or a reQQtt'Cili&tion.
...
__tragedy as an aesthetic phenomenon__. The __tragic is the aesthetic form of joy, not a medical phrase or a moral solution to pain, fear or pity.__ 

__It is joy that is tragic.__ But this means that tragedy is immediately joyful, that it only calls forth the fear and pity of the obtuse spectator, __the pathological and moralising listener__ who counts on it to ensure the proper functioning of his moral sublimations and medical purgings.

And indeed, a true renaissance is needed in order to __liberate the tragic from all the fear or pity of__ the bad listeners who gave it a mediocre sense born of __bad conscience__.

p19

A god was needed to __interpret existence__. It was __necessary to accuse life in order to redeem it, to redeem it in order to justify it.__ Existence was evaluated but __always from the standpoint of bad conscience.__

As we have seen suffering was used as a way of proving the injustice of __existence__, but at the same time as a way of finding a higher and divine justification for it. (__It is blameworthy because it suffers, but because it suffers it is atoned for and redeemed.__)

The Greeks themselves interpreted and evaluated __existence as excess.__

p20

But he only had to discover the true Dionysus in order to see the __trap__ it hides or the end it served: it made __existence a moral and religious phenomenon__! Existence seems to be given so much by being made a crime, an excess. It gains a double nature - an immense injustice and a justifying atonement. It is Titanised by crime, it is made divine by the expiation of crime. And what is there at the end of all this if not a __subtle way of depreciating existence__, of __subjecting it to judgment__, __moral judgment__ and above all __God's judgment__?

p21

"Everywhere where __responsibilities__ have been sought it is the instinct of __revenge__ that __has sought them__. This instinct of __revenge__ has gained such a hold on humanity through the centuries that __all of metaphysics, psychology, history and above all morality bear its imprint__. As soon as man began thinking he introduced the bacillus of revenge into things" (VP III 458).

"I wished to conquer the feeling of a full irresponsibility, to __make myself independent of praise and blame__, of present and past" (VP III 383, 465). __Irresponsibility - Nietzsche's most noble and beautiful secret.__

When the Greeks spoke of __existence as criminal and "hubric" they thought that the gods had driven men mad__; existence is blameworthy but it is the __gods who take upon themselves the responsibility for the fault__. This is the __great difference between__ the Greek interpretation of __crime__ and the Christian interpretation of __sin__. "'Foolishness', 'folly', a little 'disturbance in the head', this much even the Greeks of the strongest, bravest age conceded of themselves as __the reason for much that was bad__ and calamitous - __foolishness, not sin!__ ... 'He must have been deluded by a god' they concluded finally, shaking their heads . . . In this way the __gods__ served in those days to justify man to a certain extent even in his wickedness, they served as originators of evil - in those days they __took upon themselves not the punishment but__, what is nobler, __the guilt__." (GM II 23 p. 94).
