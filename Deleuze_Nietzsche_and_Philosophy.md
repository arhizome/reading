# The Tragic

p1
__Evaluations__, in essence, __are__ not values but __ways of being__, modes of existence of those who judge and evaluate, serving as principles for the values on the basis of which
they judge.


p3
__Critique is not a re-action of re-sentiment but the active expression of an active mode of existence; attack and not revenge, the natural aggression of a way of being,__ the divine wickedness without which perfection could not be imagined (EH 16-7). This way of being is that of the philosopher precisely because he intends to wield the differential element as critic and creator and therefore as a hammer. 

p3

All force is appropriation, domination, exploitation of a quantity of reality. Even __perception__, in its divers aspects, __is the expression of forces which appropriate nature.__

p3-4
__Sense__ is therefore a complex notion; there is always a plurality of senses, a constellation, a complex of successions but also of coexistences which make interpretation an art. "All subjugation, all domination amounts to a new interpretation."
[...]
There is no event, no phenomenon, word or thought which does not have a multiple sense. A thing is sometimes this, sometimes that, sometimes something more complicated-depending on the forces (the gods) which take possession of it.

p4

__religion does not have a unique sense,__ it serves many forces.

p6

Genealogy does not only interpret, it also evaluates. Up to now we have presented things as if different forces struggled over and took successive possession of an almost inert object. But __the object itself is force, expression of a force__. This is why there is more or less affinity between the object and the force which takes possession of it. __There is no object (phenomenon) which is not already possessed__ since in itself it is not an appearance but the apparition of a force.

p7

For __the will__ is not exercised mysteriously on muscles or nerves, still less on "matter in general", but __is necessarily exercised on another will.__ The real problem is not that of the relation of will to the involuntary but rather of the relation of a will that commands to a will that obeys - that obeys to a greater or lesser extent.

__The will is called a complex thing because insofar as it wills it wills obedience - but only a will can obey commands.__

__"In all willing it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on the basis of a social structure composed of many 'souls'"__ (BGE 19 p. 31) When Nietzsche praises egoism it is always in an aggressive or polemical way, against the virtues, against the virtue of disinterestedness (Z III "Of the Three Evil Things"). __But__ in fact __egoism is a bad interpretation of will, just as atomism is a bad interpretation of force.__ In order for there to be egoism it is necessary for there to be an ego. What directs us towards the origin is the fact that __every force is related to another, whether in order to command or to obey.__ The origin is the difference in the origin, difference in the origin is hierarchy, that is to say the relation of a dominant to a dominated force, of an obeyed to an obeying will.

p8

__Life struggles with another kind of life.__ Pluralism sometimes appears to be dialectical - but it is its most ferocious enemy, its only profound enemy.

In Nietzsche __the essential relation of one force to another is never conceived of as a negative element__ in the essence. In its relation with the other __the force which makes itself obeyed does not deny the other or that which it is not, it affirms its own difference and *enjoys* this difference.__

p9

__The negate is not present in the essence__ as that from which force draws its activity: on the contrary __it is a result of activity__, of the existence of an active force and the affirmation of its difference.

As for the negative concept (that is to say, __negation as a concept__) "it __is only a subsequently-invented pale contrasting image in relation to its positive basic concept__ - filled with life and passion through and through" (GM 110 p. 37).

__For the speculative element of negation, opposition or contradiction Nietzsche substitutes the practical element of difference, the object of affirmation and enjoyment.__

The question which Nietzsche constantly repeats, "what does a will want, what does this one or that one want?", must not be understood as the search for a goal, a motive or an object for this will. __What a will wants is to affirm its difference.__ In its essential relation with the "other" a will makes its difference an object of affirmation.

Furthermore, we must ask what does the dialectician himself want?
__What does this will which wills the dialectic want? It is an exhausted force which does not have the strength to affirm its difference, a force which no longer acts but rather reacts to the forces which dominate it__ - only such a force brings to the foreground the negative element in its relation to the other. Such a force __denies all that it is not and makes this negation its own essence__ and the principle of its existence. "While every noble morality develops from a triumphant affirmation of itself, slave morality from the outset says No to what is 'outside', what is 'different' what is 'not itself and this No is its creative deed" (GM110 p. 36).

p10

This is why Nietzsche presents __the dialectic__ as the speculation of the pleb, as __the way of thinking of the slave__: __the abstract thought of contradiction then prevails over the concrete feeling of positive difference, reaction over action, *revenge and ressentiment take the place of aggression*.__

Moreover the __relation of master and slave is not, in itself, dialectical__. Who is the dialectician, who dialectises the relationship? It is the slave, the __slave's perspective__, the way of thinking belonging to the slave's perspective. __The famous dialectical aspect of the master-slave relationship depends on the fact that power is conceived not as will to power but as representation of power__, representation of superiority, recognition by "the one" of the superiority of "the other". 


What the wills in Hegel want is to have their power recognised,
to represent their power. According to Nietzsche we have here a __wholly erroneous conception of the will to power__ and its nature. This is the slave's conception, it is the image that the man of ressentiment has of power. __The slave only conceives of power as the object of a recognition, the content of a representation, the stake in a competition,__ and therefore makes it depend, at the end of a fight, on a simple attribution of established values.

...__the portrait of the master that Hegel offers us is, from the start, a portrait which represents the slave, at least as he is in his dreams, as at best a successful slave.__ Underneath the Hegelian image of the master we always find the slave.

p13

In the Birth of Tragedy __the tragic in its totality is thus defined as original contradiction__, its Dionysian solution and the dramatic expression of this solution. It is characteristic of tragic culture and its modern representatives - Kant, Schopenhauer and Wagner - to reproduce and resolve the contradiction, to resolve it in reproducing it, to resolve it on the original basis. "Its most important characteristic is that __wisdom takes the place of science as the highest end__ - wisdom that, uninfluenced by the seductive distractions of the sciences, __turns with unmoved eyes to a comprehensive view of the world and seeks to grasp, with sympathetic feelings of love, the eternal suffering as its own__" (BT 18 p. 112). 

    p12
    Dionysus and Apollo are therefore not opposed as the terms of a contradiction but rather as two antithetical ways of resolving it; Apollo mediately, in the contemplation of the plastic image, Dionysus immediately in the reproduction, in the musical symbol of the will.

p14

__Dionysus__ is insistently presented as the _affirmative and affirming_ god. He is __not content with "resolving" pain in a higher and suprapersonal pleasure__ but rather __he affirms it and turns it into someone's pleasure__. This is why Dionysus is himself transformed in multiple affirmations, rather than being dissolved in original being or reabsorbing multiplicity into primeval depths. __He affirms the pains of growth rather than reproducing the sufferings of individuation. He is the god who affirms life, for whom life must be affirmed, but not justified or redeemed.__

p 15

For Christianity the fact of suffering in __life__ means primarily that life is not just, that it is even essentially unjust, that it pays for an essential injustice by suffering, it __is blameworthy because it suffers__. __The result of this is that life must be justified__, that is to say, redeemed of its injustice or saved. __Saved by that suffering__ which a little while ago accused it: it must suffer since it is blameworthy.

These two aspects of Christianity form what Nietzsche calls "bad conscience" or the internalization of pain (GMII). 

They define truly Christian nihilism, that is to say the way in which __Christianity denies life__; on the one side the __machine for manufacturing guilt__, the horrible pain-punishment equation, on the other side the machine to multiply pain, the justification by pain, the dark workshop.

Even when Christianity sings the praises of love and life what curses there are in these songs, what hatred beneath this love! __It loves life like the bird of prey loves the lamb; tender, mutilated and dying.__ The dialectician posits Christian love as an antithesis, for example as the antithesis of Judaic hatred. But it is the profession and mission of the dialectician to establish antitheses everywhere where there are more delicate evaluations to be made, coordinations to be interpreted. That the flower is the antithesis of the leaf, that it "refutes" the leaf - this is a celebrated discovery dear to the dialectic. This is also the way in which the flower of Christian love "refutes" hate - that is to say, in an entirely fictitious manner. "One should not imagine that love . . . grew up . . . as the opposite of Jewish hatred! No, the reverse is true! That love grew out of it as its crown, as its triumphant crown spreading itself farther and farther into the purest brightness and sunlight, driven as it were into the domain of light and the heights in the pursuit of the goals of that hatred-victory, spoil and seduction" (GM 18 p. 35*).

__How different this aspect is from the true Dionysus!__ The Dionysus of the Birth of Tragedy still "resolved" pain, the joy that he experienced was still the joy of resolving it and also of bearing this resolution in the primeval unity. But now Dionysus has seized the sense and value of his own transformations, he is the god for whom __life does not have to be justified__, for whom life is essentially just. 

Moreover it is life which takes charge of justification, "it affirms even the harshest suffering" (VP IV 464). We must be clear, it does __not resolve pain by internalising it, it affirms it in the element of its exteriority__. And, from this, the opposition of Dionysus and Christ is developed point by point as that of the affirmation of life (its extreme valuation) and the negation of life (its extreme depreciation). 

p16

...there are __two kinds of suffering and sufferers__. 

__"Those who suffer from the superabundance of life"__ make suffering an affirmation in the same way as they make intoxication an activity; in the laceration of Dionysus they recognise the extreme form of affirmation, with no possibility of subtraction, exception or choice.

__"Those who suffer__, on the contrary, __from an impoverishment of life"__ make intoxication a convulsion, a numbness; they make suffering a means of accusing life, of contradicting it and also a means of justifying life, of resolving the contradiction.

there is no more beautiful __saviour__ than the one __who would be__ simultaneously __executioner, victim and comforter__, the Holy Trinity, the wonderful dream of bad conscience.

From the point of view of a saviour, "life must be the path which leads to sainthood". From the point of view of Dionysus, __"existence seems holy enough by itself to justify a further immensity of suffering"__ (VP IV 464).

p17

Dionysus affirms all that appears, "even the most bitter suffering", and appears in all that is affirmed.

__Multiple and pluralist affirmation__ - this is the essence of the tragic. 
... We must find, for each thing in turn, the special means by which it is affirmed, by which it ceases to be negative.

What __defines the tragic is the joy of multiplicity, plural joy__. This joy is not the result of a sublimation, a purging, a compensation, a resignation or a reQQtt'Cili&tion.
...
__tragedy as an aesthetic phenomenon__. The __tragic is the aesthetic form of joy, not a medical phrase or a moral solution to pain, fear or pity.__ 

__It is joy that is tragic.__ But this means that tragedy is immediately joyful, that it only calls forth the fear and pity of the obtuse spectator, __the pathological and moralising listener__ who counts on it to ensure the proper functioning of his moral sublimations and medical purgings.

And indeed, a true renaissance is needed in order to __liberate the tragic from all the fear or pity of__ the bad listeners who gave it a mediocre sense born of __bad conscience__.

p19

A god was needed to __interpret existence__. It was __necessary to accuse life in order to redeem it, to redeem it in order to justify it.__ Existence was evaluated but __always from the standpoint of bad conscience.__

As we have seen suffering was used as a way of proving the injustice of __existence__, but at the same time as a way of finding a higher and divine justification for it. (__It is blameworthy because it suffers, but because it suffers it is atoned for and redeemed.__)

The Greeks themselves interpreted and evaluated __existence as excess.__

p20

But he only had to discover the true Dionysus in order to see the __trap__ it hides or the end it served: it made __existence a moral and religious phenomenon__! Existence seems to be given so much by being made a crime, an excess. It gains a double nature - an immense injustice and a justifying atonement. It is Titanised by crime, it is made divine by the expiation of crime. And what is there at the end of all this if not a __subtle way of depreciating existence__, of __subjecting it to judgment__, __moral judgment__ and above all __God's judgment__?

p21

"Everywhere where __responsibilities__ have been sought it is the instinct of __revenge__ that __has sought them__. This instinct of __revenge__ has gained such a hold on humanity through the centuries that __all of metaphysics, psychology, history and above all morality bear its imprint__. As soon as man began thinking he introduced the bacillus of revenge into things" (VP III 458).

"I wished to conquer the feeling of a full irresponsibility, to __make myself independent of praise and blame__, of present and past" (VP III 383, 465). __Irresponsibility - Nietzsche's most noble and beautiful secret.__

When the Greeks spoke of __existence as criminal and "hubric" they thought that the gods had driven men mad__; existence is blameworthy but it is the __gods who take upon themselves the responsibility for the fault__. This is the __great difference between__ the Greek interpretation of __crime__ and the Christian interpretation of __sin__. "'Foolishness', 'folly', a little 'disturbance in the head', this much even the Greeks of the strongest, bravest age conceded of themselves as __the reason for much that was bad__ and calamitous - __foolishness, not sin!__ ... 'He must have been deluded by a god' they concluded finally, shaking their heads . . . In this way the __gods__ served in those days to justify man to a certain extent even in his wickedness, they served as originators of evil - in those days they __took upon themselves not the punishment but__, what is nobler, __the guilt__." (GM II 23 p. 94).

p26

The __dice__ which are thrown once are the __affirmation of chance__, the combination which they form on falling is the affirmation of necessity. __Necessity is affirmed of chance in exactly the sense that being is affirmed of becoming and unity is affirmed of multiplicity.__

just as __unity does not suppress or deny multiplicity__, __necessity does not suppress or abolish chance__. Nietzsche identifies chance with multiplicity, with fragments, with parts, with chaos: the chaos of the dice that are shaken and then thrown. Nietzsche __turns chance into an affirmation.__

p31

From the pluralist standpoint a sense is referred to __the differential element__ from which its significance is derived, just as values are referred to the differential element from which their value is derived. This element which __is always present__, but also always implicit and hidden in the poem or aphorism __is like the second dimension of sense and values.__ __It is by developing this element and by developing itself in it that philosophy__ in its essential relation with the poem and the aphorism __constitutes complete interpretation and evaluation__, that is to say, __the art of thinking__, faculty of thought or "faculty of rumination" (GM Preface 8 p. 23).

__Rumination and eternal return__: two stomachs are not too many for thinking.

p32

__To think is to send out a dicethrow.__ Only a dicethrow, on the basis of chance, could affirm necessity and produce "the unique number which cannot be another".

The dice which fall are a constellation, their points form the number "born of the stars". The table of the dicethrow is therefore double, sea of chance and sky of necessity, midnight-midday.

Not only is the __throwing of the dice__ an __unreasonable and irrational, absurd and superhuman__ act, but it constitutes the tragic attempt and __the tragic thought par excellence__.

__The number-constellation is, or could be, the book, the work of art as outcome__ and justification __of the world.__

p33 

The dicethrow is nothing when detached from innocence and the affirmation of chance. __The dicethrow is nothing if chance and necessity are opposed in it.__

p34

Nietzsche calls __the enterprise of denying life and depreciating existence nihilism.__ He analyses the principal forms of nihilism, ressentiment, bad conscience, ascetic ideal; the whole of nihilism and its forms he calls the spirit of revenge. But, the different forms of nihilism are __not at all reducible to psychological determinations, historical events or ideological currents, not even to metaphysical structures.__

The spirit of revenge is undoubtedly expressed biologically, psychologically, historically and metaphysically; the spirit of revenge is a type, it is not separable from a typology, the key stone of Nietzschean philosophy.

__Ressentiment is not part of psychology but the whole of our psychology, without knowing it, is a part of ressentiment.__

when Nietzsche undertakes the critique of nihilism he makes __nihilism the presupposition of all metaphysics__ rather than the expression of particular metaphysics: __there is no metaphysics which does not judge and depreciate life in the name of a supra-sensible world.__

We cannot even say that nihilism and its forms are categories of thought, for __the categories of thought, of reasonable thought - identity, causality, finality - themselves presuppose an interpretation of force which is that of ressentiment.__ 

"__The instinct of revenge__ has gained such a hold on humanity over the centuries that the __whole of metaphysics, psychology, history and above all morality bear its imprint.__ As soon as man began thinking he  introduced the bacillus of revenge into things" (VP III 458).

p35

__For a long time we have only been able to think in terms of ressentiment and bad conscience.__ We have had no other ideal but the ascetic ideal. We have opposed knowledge to life in order to judge life, in order to make it something blameworthy, responsible or erroneous. __We turned will into something bad, something stricken by a basic contradiction: we have said that it must be rectified, restrained, limited and even denied and suppressed.__

p36

"It is not necessary to wait", Nietzsche says, "for unhappiness, as those who make philosophy derive from dissatisfaction think. __It is in happiness that one must begin, in full virile maturity, in the fire of this burning joy which is that of the adult and victorious age__" (PTG 1).
<!-- The myth of the "happy childhood". We start from unhappiness. -->

# Active and Reactive

p39

__Spinoza__ suggested a new direction for the sciences and philosophy. He said that __we do not even know what a body can do, we talk about consciousness and spirit and chatter on about it all, but we do not know what a body is capable of, what forces belong to it or what they are preparing for__. Nietzsche knew that the hour had come, "We are in the phase of modesty of consciousness" (VP II 261/WP 676).

However, __consciousness is defined less__ in relation to exteriority (__in terms of the real__) __than__ in relation to superiority (__in terms of values__).

"Consciousness usually only appears when a whole wants to subordinate itself to a superior whole . . . Consciousness is born in relation to a being of which we could be a function" (VP II227). This is the servility of  consciousness; it merely testifies to the "formation of a superior body".

p40 

__There is no quantity of reality, all reality is already quantity of force.__

Inferior forces do not, by obeying, cease to be forces distinct from those which command. Obeying is a quality of force as such and relates to power just as much as commanding does: "__individual power is by no means surrendered.__ In the same way, _there is in commanding an admission that the absolute power of the opponent has not been vanquished, incorporated, disintegrated._ __'Obedience' and 'commanding' [both] are forms of struggle.__" (VP II 91/WP 642) 

p42

_The idea that science must follow in the footsteps of consciousness_, in the same directions, _is absurd._ We can sense _the morality in this idea_. In fact there can only be science where there is no consciousness, where there can be no consciousness.


p47

By persisting in demanding how becoming could have started and why it has not yet finished, the philosophers of antiquity are __false__ tragics, __invoking hubris, crime and punishment__.

p51

it is through will to power that [a force] obeys

p54

__Affirming and denying, appreciating and depreciating, express the will to power just as acting and reacting express force__. (And just as reactive forces are still forces, the will to deny, nihilism, is still will to power: " . . . a will to nothingness, an aversion to life, a rebellion against the most fundamental presuppositions of life; but it is and remains a will!" GM III 28 p. 163)

There is a deep affinity, a complicity, but never a confusion, between action and affirmation, between reaction and negation.

On the one hand, it is clear that there is __affirmation in every action__ and __negation in every reaction__. But, on the other hand, __action and reaction are__ more like means, __means or instruments of the will to power which affirms and denies__, just as reactive forces are instruments of nihilism.

Affirmation is not action but the power of becoming active, becoming active personified. Negation is not simple reaction but a becoming reactive.

p57

"vile", "ignoble" and "slave" comes from - these words designate the state of reactive forces that place themselves on high and entice active force into a trap, __replacing masters with slaves who do not stop being slaves.__

p58

active forces are the superior, dominant and strongest forces. But inferior forces can prevail without ceasing to be inferior in quantity and reactive in quality, without ceasing to be slaves in this sense. One of the finest remarks in The Will to Power is: "__The strong always have to be defended against the weak__" (VP I 395).

Everything that separates a force from what it can do he calls law. __Law__, in this sense, __expresses the triumph of the weak over the strong.__ Nietzsche adds: the triumph of reaction over action.

The slave does not stop being a slave by being triumphant; when the weak triumph it is not by forming a greater force but by separating force from what it can do.

p59

How can he explain to Socrates that __"desire" is not the association of a pleasure and a pain__, the pain of  experiencing it and the pleasure of satisfying it? How can he explain that __pleasure and pain are reactions, properties of reactive forces, the proof of adaptation or lack of it__? And how can Socrates be made to understand that __the weak do not form a stronger force__? Socrates has partially misunderstood and partially misheard - he is too full of dialectical ressentiment and the spirit of revenge.

Nietzsche also encounters his own Socrates. These are the free thinkers. They say: "What are you complaining about? How could the weak have triumphed if they did not form superior force?" "Let us bow down before accomplished fact" (GM I 9). This is __modern positivism__. They claim to carry out the __critique of values__, they claim to __refuse all appeals to transcendent values__, they declare them unfashionable, but only in order to rediscover them as the force which run the world of today. The value of Church, morality, State etc. is only discussed so that their human force and content can be admired.

p60

__The free thinker__ wants to recover the content of religion but never considers that __religion__ might in fact __contain man's basest forces__, forces which we might want to leave behind. This is why we can have no confidence in the free thinker's atheism, even when he's a democrat and a socialist: "__It is the church, and not its poison that repels us__" (GM I 9 p. 36). The essential characteristics of the free thinker's positivism and humanism are fatalism, interpretative impotence and ignorance of the qualities of force.

__the fact is always something used by the weak against the strong__; "the fact is __always stupid__, having at all times resembled a calf rather than a god" (UM II "Use and Abuse of History" 8)

"There are no facts, nothing but interpretations" (VP II 133)

p61

__Strength or weakness__ cannot be judged by taking the result and success of struggle as a criterion.

p62

__will to power is manifested as a capacity for being affected.__ This capacity is not an abstract possibility, it is necessarily fulfilled and actualised at each moment by the other forces to which a given force relates.

__The more ways a body could be affected the more force it had.__

the __capacity for being affected is__ not necessarily a passivity but an affectivity, a sensibility, a sensation.

"The will to power is not a being not a becoming, but a pathos" (VP II 311/WP 635)

p63

"The fact is that __the will to power rules even in the inorganic world__, or rather that there is no inorganic world. __Action at a distance cannot be eliminated, for one thing attracts another and a thing feels itself attracted.__ This is the fundamental fact. . .In order for the will to power to be able to manifest itself it needs to perceive the things it sees and feel the approach of what is assimilable to it" (VP II 89).

The effects of force are active insofar as the __force appropriates anything that resists it__ and compels the obedience of inferior force.

Again, __obeying is a manifestation of the will to power__.

not only do __disintegration, division and separation always express will to power__ but so do being disintegrated, being separated and being divided: "Division appears as the consequence of the will to power" (VP II73).

All __sensibility is only a becoming of forces__.

p65

shepherd "writhing, choking, convulsed, his face  distorted", a heavy black snake hanging out of his mouth (Z III "Of the Vision and the Riddle" p. 180). Later, Zarathustra himself explains the vision: "The great disgust at man - it choked me and had crept into my throat. . .

. . .And eternal return, even for the smallest - that was my __disgust__ at all existence! Ah, disgust! Disgust! Disgust!" (Z III "The Convalescent" pp. 235-6).

In order to affirm the eternal return it is necessary to bite off and spit out the snake's head. Then the shepherd is no longer either man or shepherd, "he was transformed, surrounded with light, he was laughing! Never yet on earth had any man laughed as he laughed" (Z III "Of the Vision and the Riddle" p. 80*). Another becoming, another sensibility: the Overman.
<!-- Becoming the Overman is to get rid of disgust. -->

p66

A __reactive force__ can certainly be considered from different points of view. Illness for example . . . __They separate us from our power but at the same time they give us another power, "dangerous" and "interesting".__ They bring us __new feelings and teach us new ways of being affected__. There is something __admirable__ in the becoming-reactive of forces, admirable and dangerous. Not only the sick man, but even the religious man present this double aspect: reactive on the one hand, possessing a new power on the other. "Human history would be altogether too stupid a thing without the spirit that the impotent have introduced into it" (GM I 7 p. 33). 

p67

_There are reactive forces that become grandiose and fascinating by following the will to nothingness and there are active forces that subside because they do not know how to follow the powers of affirmation._

# Critique

p74

Wecan guess __the source of "utility"__: it is the source of all passive concepts in general, __ressentiment__, nothing but the requirements of ressentiment. Utility serves us as an example here. But, in any case, the taste for replacing real relations between forces by an abstract relation which is supposed to express them all, as a measure, seems to be an integral part of science and also of philosophy. In this respect Hegel's objective spirit is no more valid than the no less "objective" concept of utility. Now, in this abstract relation, whatever it is, we always end up replacing real activities (creating, speaking, loving etc.) by the third party's perspective on these activities: __the essence of the activity is confused with the gains of a third party__, which he claims that he ought to profit from, whose benefits he claims the right to reap (_whether he is God, objective spirit, humanity, culture or even the proletariat_. . .).

p77

when we ask the question "what is it?" (qu'est-ce que) we not only fall into the worst metaphysics but in fact we merely ask the question "which one?" in a blind, unconscious and confused way. The question "what is it?" is a way of establishing a sense seen from another point of view. __Essence, being, is a perspectival reality and presupposes a plurality.__ Fundamentally it is __always the question "What is it for me?"__ (for us, for everyone that sees etc.) (VP 1204).

p79

According to Nietzsche the__ inhuman and the superhuman__ - a thing, an animal or a god - are __no less capable of dramatisation__ than a man or his determinations. They too are transformations of Dionysus, __symptoms of a will which wants something__.

p80

__As if power were what the will wanted.__ But, such a conception implies at least three misunderstandings which threaten the whole philosophy of the will:
1) Power is interpreted as the object of representation.
... 
In Hobbes, man in the state of nature wants to see his __superiority represented and recognised by others__. In Hegel, __consciousness__ wants to be __recognised by another and represented as self-consciousness__. Even in Adler it is still a matter of the representation of a superiority which, when necessary, compensates for the existence of an organic inferiority. 
...
Nietzsche asks: __who conceives of the will to power as a will to get oneself recognised?__ Who conceives of power itself as the object of a recognition? Who essentially wants to be represented as superior and even wants his inferiority to be represented as superiority? It is the sick who want "to represent superiority under any form whatsoever" (GM III 14). "__It is the slave__ who seeks to persuade us to have a good opinion of him; it is also __the slave__ who then __bends his knee before these opinions as if it wasn't him who produced them.__

p81
In fact __everything has happened between slaves, conquering or conquered__. The __mania for representing, for being represented__, for getting oneself represented; for having representatives and representeds: this is the mania that is common to all slaves, the only relation between themselves they can conceive of, the relation that they impose with their triumph.

"The common man never had any value but that which was attributed to him; in no way accustomed to positing values himself, he attributed to himself no other value than that which was recognised in him" (BGE 261), or even that which he got them to recognise.

p82

It is characteristic of established values to be brought into play in a struggle, but it is __characteristic of the struggle to be always referred to established values__: whether it is __struggle for power, struggle for recognition or struggle for life - the schema is always the same__. 

One cannot overemphasise the extent to which the notions of struggle, war, rivalry or even comparison are foreign to Nietzsche and to his conception of the will to power. It is not that he denies the existence of __struggle__: but he does not see it as __in any way creative of values__. At least, __the only values that it creates are those of the triumphant slave__. 

__Struggle is not the principle or the motor of hierarchy but the means by which the slave reverses hierarchy.__ Struggle is never the active expression of forces, nor the manifestation of a will to power that affirms—any more than its result expresses the triumph of the master or the strong. __Struggle__, on the contrary, __is the means by which the weak prevail over the strong__, because they are the greatest number. This is why Nietzsche is opposed to Darwin: __Darwin confused struggle and selection__. He failed to see that the result of struggle was the opposite of what he thought; that it does select, but it selects only the weak and assures their triumph (VP I 395, TI). 

p87

The creator of values cannot be distinguished from a destroyer, from a criminal or from a critic: a critic of established values, reactive values and baseness.

p89

__Kant__ merely pushed a very old conception of critique to the limit, a conception which saw __critique as a force which should be brought to bear on all claims to knowledge and truth, but not on knowledge and truth themselves__; a force which should be brought to bear __on all claims to morality, but not on morality itself__.


Critique is nothing and says nothing insofar as it is content to say that true morality makes fun of morality. __Critique has done nothing insofar as it has not been brought to bear on truth itself, on true knowledge, on true morality, on true religion.__

Every time that __Nietzsche denounces virtue__ he is __not__ denouncing __false virtues__, nor those which make use of virtue as a mask. It is __virtue itself in itself, that is to say the pettiness of true virtue, the unbelievable mediocrity of true morality, the baseness of its authentic values that he attacks__.

p92

"Their 'knowing' is creating, their creating is a law-giving, their will to truth is - will to power" (BGE 211 p. 123). 

__Understanding and reason__ have a long history: they are instances which still __make us obey__ when we no longer want to obey anyone. When we stop obeying God, the State, our parents, reason appears and persuades us to continue being docile because it says to us: it is you who are giving the orders. Reason represents our slavery and our subjection as some thing superior which make us reasonable beings.

p97

Nevertheless, there is perhaps __one reason why we might like to distinguish and even oppose knowledge, morality and religion__. We ascended from truth to the ascetic ideal in order to discover the source f the concept of truth. Let us for a moment turn our attention to ?olution instead of genealogy: let us descend again from the ascetic or religious ideal to the will to truth. We must then acknowledge that orality has replaced religion as a dogma and that science is increasingly replacing morality. 

p98

__Morality is the continuation of religion__ but by other means; __knowledge is the continuation of morality and religion__ but by other means. The ascetic ideal is everywhere, but its means change, they are no longer the same reactive forces. This is why critique is so easily confused with a settling of accounts between different reactive forces.

he will to truth is still part of the ascetic ideal

As soon as we ask __what the ascetic and religious ideal is__, as soon as we put this question to the ideal itself, __morality or virtue come forward to answer in its stead.__ 

__Virtue says__: "What you are attacking is myself, I answer for the ascetic ideal; in religion there is bad but there is also good; I have collected this good together, it is I who wills this good." 

And when we ask: "__but what is this virtue, what does it want?__" the same story begins again. 

__Truth itself comes forward saying__: "It is I who wills virtue, I answer for virtue. It is my mother and my goal. I am nothing if I do not lead to virtue. And who will deny that I am something?"

__truth itself is not beyond criticism or in possession of a divine right__. Critique must be a critique of truth itself. 

p99
__what meaning would our whole being possess if__ it were not this, that in us __the will to truth becomes conscious of itself as a problem__?

In this sense we too are "truthfull" or "seekers after knowledge". But __we do not replace the ascetic ideal__, we let nothing of the place itself remain, __we want to destroy the place, we want another ideal in another place, another way of knowing, another concept of truth__, that is to say a truth which is not presupposed in a will to truth but which presupposes a completely different will.

p102

_Art is always judged from the point of view of the spectator_ and a less and less artistic spectator at that. __Nietzsche demands an aesthetics of creation__, the aesthetics of Pygmalion. But why, from this new standpoint, does art emerge as a stimulant of the will to power? Why does the will to power need something to excite it when it needs no motive, goal or representation? This is because it can only be set up as affirmative in relation to active forces, to an active life. __Affirmation is the product of a way of thinking which presupposes an active life__ as its condition and concomitant. 

__art is the highest power of falsehood__, it magnifies the "world as error", it sanctifies the lie; the will to deception is turned into a superior ideal.

p103

For the artist, appearance no longer means the negation of the real in this world but this kind of selection, correction, redoubling and affirmation. Then truth perhaps takes on a new sense. __Truth is appearance__. Truth means bringing of power into effect, raising to the highest power. In Nietzsche, __"we the artists" = "we the seekers after knowledge or truth" = "we the inventors of new possibilities of life".__

The __dogmatic image of thought__ can be summarised in three essential
theses:
1) We are told that the thinker as __thinker wants and loves truth__ 
2) We are also told that __we are "diverted" from the truth by__ forces which are foreign to it (__body, passions, sensuous interests__).
3) We are told, finally, that all we need to think well, to think truthfully, is a method.

The most curious thing about this image of thought is the way in which __it conceives of truth as an abstract universal__. We are never referred to the real forces that form thought, thought itself is never related to the real forces that it presupposes as thought. __Truth is never related to what it presupposes.__

But there is no truth that, before being a truth, is not the bringing into effect of a sense or the realisation of a value. Truth, as a concept, is entirely undetermined. __Everything depends on the value and sense of what we think.__ 

104

__We always have the truths we deserve as a function of the sense of what we conceive, of the value of what we believe.__ Any thinkable or thought sense is only brought into effect insofar as the forces that correspond to it in thought also take hold of something, appropriate something, outside thought. Clearly __thought cannot think by itself__, any more than it can find truth by itself. The truth of a thought must be interpreted and evaluated according to the forces or power that determine it to think and to think this rather than that.

When we speak of "plain truth", of truth "in itself, "for itself or even "for us", we must ask what forces are hiding themselves in the thought of this truth, and therefore what its sense and value is. 

It is disturbing that truth conceived as an abstract universal, thought conceived as pure science, has never hurt anyone.
<!-- AHAHAHA!!! xD Yeah, that never happened! -->

In fact the established order and current values constantlyfind their best support in truth conceived in this way

This is what the dogmatic image of thought conceals: the work of established forces that determine thought as pure science, the work of established powers that are ideally expressed in truth in itself. 

A new image of thought means primarily that truth is not the element of thought. The element of thought is sense and value.

p105

__The concept of error__ would therefore press, by right, the worst that can happen to thought, that is to say the state of thought separated from truth. 

Here again Nietzsche accepts the problem as it is posed by right. But, in reality, the almost __laughable character of the examples__ usually invoked by philosophers in order __to illustrate error__ (saying "Hello Thaetetus . . ." when one meets Theodore . . . saying "3 + 2 = 6") is enough to __show that this concept__ of error is merely the extrapolation of __puerile, artificial or grotesque factual situations__. 

Who says "3 + 2 = 6" apart from the small child at school? Who says "Hello Thaetetus. . ."apart from the short-sighted or the absent-minded? 

<!-- Trans lense for Thaetetus, name change that refuses to be accepted. And for 3+2: number are signs, there can be another framework here, too. 1+1=10 absolutely correct in a binary system, an error in a decimal system. -->

Mature, considered thought has other enemies; negative states which are profound in entirely different ways. 

__Stupidity is a structure of thought__ as such: it is not a means of self-deception, it expresses the non-sense in thought by right. __Stupidity is not error__ or a tissue of errors. There are imbecile thoughts, imbecile discourses, that are made up entirely of truths; but these truths are base, they are those of a base, heavy and leaden soul.

__The concept of truth can only be determined on the basis of a pluralist typology.__ And typology begins with a topology.

Subjecting truth to the test of the base, but also subjecting falsity to the test of the high: this is the really critical task and the only way of knowing where one is in relation to "truth". 

p106

Philosophy's mystification begins, however, from the moment it renounces its role as demystifier and takes the established powers into consideration: when it gives up the harming of stupidity and the denunciation of baseness.

p107

__the image of the philosopher__ is constantly __obscured__. He is turned into a sage, he who is only the friend of wisdom, friend in an ambiguous sense, that is to say, an anti-sage, he who must be __masked with wisdom in order to survive.__

Unlike the atemporal concept of error, __baseness is inseparable from time__, that is from this rapture of the present, from this present condition in which it is incarnated and in which it moves.

And in the untimely there are truths that are more durable than all historical and eternal truths put together: truths of times to come.

The succession of philosophers is __not an eternal sequence of sages__, still less a historical sequence, but a __broken succession__, a succession __of comets__.

p108

__Thinking depends on forces which take hold of thought.__ Insofar as our thinking is controlled by reactive forces, insofar as it finds its sense in reactive forces, we must admit that we are not yet thinking. Thinking means the activity of thought; but __thought has its own ways of being inactive which can occupy it and all its forces entirely.__

Thinking, like activity, is always a second power of thought, not the natural exercise of a faculty, but an extraordinary event in thought itself, for thought itself. __Thinking is the n-th power of thought.__ It is still necessary for it to become __"light", "affirmative", "dancing"__. But __it will never attain this power if forces do not do violence to it__. Violence must be done to it as thought, a power, the force of thinking, must throw it into a becoming-active. A constraint a training of this kind is what Nietzsche calls __"Culture"__.

We will only understand the concept of __culture__ if we grasp all the ways in which it is __opposed to method__. _Method always presupposes the good will of the thinker_, "a premeditated decision". __Culture__, on the contrary, __is a violence undergone by thought__, a process of formation of thought through the action of selective forces, a training which brings the whole unconscious of the thinker into play.

p109

__When a State encourages culture "it only encourages it in order to be encouraged itself__, and it never conceives that there is an aim superior to its own good and existence".

p110

__There is nothing more false than the idea of "founts" of truth.__

The anecdote is to life what the aphorism is to thought: something to interpret.

# From Ressentiment to the Bad Conscience

p111

In the normal or healthy state the role of reactive forces is always to limit action.  They divide, delay or hinder it by means of another action whose effects we feel

reaction alone cannot constitute ressentiment. Ressentiment designates a type in which reactive forces prevail over active forces. But they can only prevail in one way: by ceasing to be acted. 

__reaction ceases to be acted in order to become something felt (senti).__ Reactive forces prevail over active forces because they escape their action. 

p112

"We will therefore suppose that an external system of the apparatus receives the perceptible excitations but retains nothing of them, and thus has no memory; and that, lying behind this system there is another which transforms the momentary excitation of the first into lasting traces " These two systems or recordings correspond to the distinction between the __conscious and the unconscious__.

p113

This active super-conscious faculty is the faculty of forgetting. Psychology's mistake was to treat __forgetting__ as a negative determination, not to discover its __active and positive__ character.

p114

We rediscover the definition of ressentiment: ressentiment is a reaction which simultaneously becomes perceptible and ceases to be acted: a formula which defines sickness in general. Nietzsche is not simply saying that ressentiment is a sickness, but rather that __sickness as such is a form of ressentiment__ (EH I 6).

p115

Why is ressentiment the spirit of revenge? It might be thought that the man of ressentiment comes into being by accident: having experienced too strong an excitation (a pain), he would have had to abandon the attempt to react, not being strong enough to form a riposte. He would therefore experience a desire for revenge and, by a process of generalisation, would want to take this out on the whole world. Such an interpretation is mistaken

As a result of his type the _man of ressentiment_ does not "react": his reaction is endless, __it is felt instead of being acted.__

p116

The man of ressentiment in himself is a being full of pain: the sclerosis or hardening of his consciousness, the rapidity with which every excitation sets and freezes within him, the weight of the traces that invade him are so many cruel sufferings.

the memory of traces is full of hatred in itself and by itself. It is venomous and depreciative because it blames the object in order to __compensate for its own inability to escape from the traces of the corresponding excitation__. This is why ressentiment's revenge, even when it is realised, remains "spiritual", imaginary and symbolic in principle. 

We have not understood ressentiment if we only see it as a desire for revenge, a desire to rebel and triumph.

p117

__Ressentiment *is* the triumph of the weak as weak,__ the revolt of the slaves and their victory as slaves. 

The type of the master (the active type) is defined in terms of the faculty of forgetting and the power of acting reactions. The type of slave (the reactive type) is defined by a prodigious memory, by the power of ressentiment; several characteristics which determine this second type follow from this.

_Inability to admire, respect or love_ (BGE 260, GM 110). The __memory of traces is itself full of hatred.__ Hatred or revenge is hidden even in the most tender and most loving memories. The ruminants of memory __disguise this hatred by__ a subtle operation which consists in __reproaching themselves with everything with which__, in fact, __they reproach the being whose memory they pretend to cherish.__

Think of the __Trojans__ who, in Helen, __respected and admired the cause of their own misfortune__. __But the man of ressentiment__ must turn misfortune into something mediocre, he must recriminate and distribute blame: look at his inclination to play down the value of causes, to __make misfortune "someone's fault"__.

p118

The man of ressentiment does not know how to and does not want to love, but wants to be loved.  He wants to be loved, fed, watered, caressed and put to sleep.

Furthermore __the man of ressentiment__ is extremely touchy: faced with all the activities he cannot undertake he considers that, at the very least, he ought to be compensated by benefiting from them. He therefore __considers it a proof of obvious malice that he is not loved__, that he is not fed. The man of ressentiment is the man of profit and gain.

who considers action from the standpoint of good and evil, of praiseworthiness and blameworthiness?

...for example, the incredible notion of disinterestedness, we realise that they conceal the demands and recriminations of a passive third party: it is __he who claims an interest in actions that he does not perform; he praises the disinterested character of precisely the actions from which he benefits.__ ... the triumphant standpoint of a slave who intervenes between masters.

The __imputation of wrongs, the distribution of responsibilities, perpetual accusation__. All this __replaces aggression__. "The aggressive pathos belongs just as necessarily to strength as vengefulness and rancour belong to weakness" (EH I 7 p. 232). 

p119

"It is your fault if no one loves me, it is your fault if I've failed in life and also your fault if you fail in yours, your misfortunes and mine are equally your fault."

Here we rediscover the __dreadful__ feminine __power of ressentiment: it is not content to denounce crimes and criminals, it wants sinners, people who are responsible.__
<!-- duuuuude... fucking feminine power my ass.... -->

We can guess what __the creature of ressentiment__ wants: he __wants others to be evil__, he needs others to be evil in order to be able to consider himself good. __You are evil, therefore I am good__; this is the slave's fundamental formula

This formula must be compared with that of __the master: I am good, therefore you are evil.__

p120

__In the master everything positive is in the premises.__ He must have premises of action and affirmation, and the enjoyment of these premises in order to conclude with something negative which is not the main point and has scarcely any importance

p121

__the good "only looks for its antithesis in order to affirm itself with more joy"__ (GM I 10). This is the status of __aggression__: it is the negative, but the negative as the conclusion of positive premises, the negative as the product of activity, the negative as the consequence of the power of affirming.

He who called himself good is the one who is now called evil. This __evil one is the one who acts__, who does not hold himself back from acting, who does not therefore consider action from the point of view of the consequences that it will have for third parties. 

And the one who is __good is now the one who holds himself back__ from acting: he is good just because he refers all actions to the standpoint of the one who does not act, to the __standpoint of the one who experiences the consequences__, or better still to the more subtle __standpoint of a divine third party who scrutinises the intentions__ of the one who acts.

"And he is good who does not outrage, who harms nobody, who does not attack, who does not requite, who leaves revenge to God, who keeps himself hidden as we do, who avoids evil and desires little from life, like us, the patient, humble and just" (GM 113 p. 46). 

p122

__Good and evil__ are new values, but how strangely these values are created! They are __created by reversing good and bad__. They are not created by acting but by holding back from acting, not by affirming, but by beginning with denial. This is why they are called un-created, divine, transcendent, superior to life.

But think of what these values hide, of their mode of creation. __They hide an extraordinary hatred__, a hatred __for life__, a hatred for all that is active and affirmative in life. __No moral values would survive for a single instant if they were separated from the premises of which they are the conclusion.__

__Christian love is not the opposite of Judaic ressentiment but its consequence__, its conclusion and its crowning glory (GM I 8). 

p124

the force thus neutralised is moralised. For, if __it is assumed that a force is able to not manifest the force that it "has"__, it is no more __absurd__ to assume, conversely, that a force could manifest the force that it "has not". As soon as forces are projected into a fictitious subject this subject proves to be blameworthy or deserving - blameworthy if active force performs the activity which is its own, deserving if reactive force does not perform the activity which it . . . does not have. 

p125

__It presides over the whole evolution of ressentiment__, that is to say, over the operations by which active force is, simultaneously, separated from what it can do (__falsification__), accused and treated as blameworthy (__depreciation__), and the corresponding values are reversed (__negation__). In and through this fiction reactive forces represent themselves as superior. "To be able to reject all that represents the ascending movement of life, well-constitutedness, power, beauty, self-affirmation on earth, the instinct of ressentiment here become genius had to invent another world from which that __life-affirmation would appear evil__, reprehensible as such" (AC 24 p. 135)


p126

We know that the __Nazis had ambiguous relations with Nietzsche's work__: ambiguous because they liked to appeal to it but could not do so without __mutilating quotations, falsifying editions and banning important texts.__

p128

"__All instincts that do not discharge themselves outwardly turn inward__ - that is what I call the internalisation of man . . . that is the origin of the 'bad conscience' " (GM II16 pp. 84-5). 

p131

The Christian-priest brings bad conscience out of its raw animal state, he presides over the internalisation of pain. __The doctor-priest heals pain by infecting the wound. The artist-priest raises bad conscience to its superior form: pain__, the consequence of a sin.

the __priest alters the direction of ressentiment__" (GM III 15 p. 127).

p132

Christianity does sound a new note. It is not content to complete ressentiment, it changes its direction. It imposes the new invention, bad conscience. But, once again, it should not be thought that the new direction of ressentiment in bad conscience is opposed to the first direction. Once again, we are merely concerned with an additional temptation, an additional seduction. __Ressentiment said "it is your fault", bad conscience says "it is my fault". But ressentiment is really only appeased when its contagion is spread.__

__It is not enough for it to accuse, the accused must feel guilty.__ 

everything active in life develops this same feeling of guilt. And these are the only preconditions for the priest's power: __by nature the priest is the one who makes himself master of those who suffer__ (GM III 15).

p133

__the priest always acts through fiction.__

___Culture means training and selection.__ Nietzsche calls the movement of culture the "__morality of customs__" (D9); this latter is __inseparable from__ iron collars, from __torture__, from the atrocious means which are used to train man.

__Every historical law is arbitrary, but what is not arbitrary, what is prehistoric and generic, is the law of obeying laws.__ (Bergson will rediscover this thesis when he shows, in Les Deux Sources, that all habits are arbitrary but that the habit of taking on habits is natural.)

p134

__Culture has always used__ the following means: it made __pain a medium of exchange, a currency__, an equivalent; precisely the exact equivalent of a forgetting, of an inquiry caused, a promise not kept (GM II4). __Culture, when related to this means, is called justice; the means itself is called punishment.__

p135

Nietzsche sees __the archetype of social organisation in credit rather than exchange__. The man who pays for the injury he causes by his pain, the man held responsible for a debt, the man treated as responsible for his reactive forces: these are the means used by culture to reach its goal. 

Nietzsche therefore offers us the owing genetic lineage: 
1) Culture as prehistoric or generic activity, an enterprise of training and selection; 
2) The means used by this activity, the equation of punishment, the relationship of debt, the responsible man; 
3) The product of this activity: the active man, free and powerful, the man who can promise.

On the one hand, revenge and ressentiment are not the origin of justice. __Moralists, even socialist ones, make justice derive from a reactive feeling, from deeply felt offence, a spirit of revenge or justiciary reaction.__ But such a derivation explains nothing it would have to show how the pain of others can be a satisfaction of revenge, a reparation for revenge. We will never understand the cruel equation "injury caused = pain undergone" if a third term is not introduced - the __pleasure which is felt in inflicting pain or in contemplating it__. But this third term, the external meaning of pain, has an origin which is completely different from revenge or reaction: it reflects an active standpoint, active force

__Justice is the generic activity that trains man's reactive forces__, that makes them suitable for being acted and holds man responsible for this suitability itself.

p136

ressentiment, far from being at the origin of justice, is "the last sphere to be conquered by the spirit of justice . . . The active, aggressive, arrogant man is still a hundred steps closer to justice than the reactive man.
<!-- Or maybe justice is just bullshit altogether. -->

Just as ressentiment is not the origin of justice so bad conscience is not the product of punishment. However many meanings punishment can have there is always one meaning which it does not have. __Punishment cannot awaken a feeling of guilt in the culprit.__

<!-- In those who punish as well as those who are punished. -->

"... Generally speaking, __punishment makes men hard and cold; it concentrates; it sharpens the feeling of alienation__; it strengthens the power of resistance. If it happens that punishment destroys the vital energy and brings about a miserable prostration and self-abasement, such a result is certainly even less pleasant than the usual effects of punishment - characterised by dry and gloomy seriousness. ..." (GM II14 pp. 81-82).

society and the morality of customs at last reveal what they have

p141

__The association of reactive forces is thus accompanied by a transformation of debt; this becomes a debt toward "divinity", toward "society", toward "the State"__, toward reactive instances. Everything then takes place between reactive forces. __Debt__ loses the active character by virtue of which it took part in man's liberation: __in its new form__ it __is inexhaustible, unpayable.__ 

Examine what Christianity calls __"redemption"__. It is no longer a matter of discharge from debt, but of a deepening of debt. It is __no longer a matter of a suffering through which debt is paid, but of a suffering through which one is shackled to it__, through which one becomes a __debtor forever__. Suffering now only pays the interest on the debt; suffering is internalised, responsibility-debt has become responsibility-guilt. 

p142

But __the priest does not only corrupt the herd, he organises it, he protects it. He invents the means which enable us to endure multiplied, internalised pain. He makes it possible to live with the culpabuity which he introduces.__ He makes us participate in an apparent activity, in an apparent injustice, the service of God; he involves us in association, he awakens in us "the desire to see the community prosper" (GM III 18-19). 

"It is my fault", this is the cry of love by means of which we, the new sirens, attract others to us and divert them from their path. __By changing the direction of ressentiment the men of bad conscience have found the best means to satisfy revenge__, to spread the contagion: "how ready they themselves are at bottom to make one pay; how they crave to be hangmen . . ."

p143

Every selection implies a religion.

Ressentiment and bad conscience - these are the higher degrees of religion as such. __The inventor of Christianity is not Christ but St Paul, the man of bad conscience, the man of ressentiment.__ 

p145
the will to nothingness needs reactive forces: it is not just that it only tolerates life in reactive form, but it needs the reactive life as a means by which __life must contradict itself, deny itself, annihilate itself__

p162

The idea of another world, of a supersensible world in all its forms (God, essence, the good, truth), __the idea of values superior to life, is__ not one example among many but __the constitutive element of all fiction.__ Values superior to life are inseparable from their effect: the depreciation of life, the negation of this world.

Nihil in "nihilism" means negation as quality of the will to power. 

__Nihilism has a second, more colloquial sense__. It no longer signifies a will but rather a reaction. The supersensible world and higher values are reacted against, their existence is denied, they are refused all validity - this is no longer the devaluation of life in the name of higher values but rather the devaluation of higher values themselves.

p148

Previously essence was opposed to appearance, life was turned into an appearance. Now essence is denied but appearance is retained: everything is merely appearance, life which is left to us remains for itself an appearance.

In its enterprise of denying life __the will to nothingness on the one hand merely tolerates the reactive life but on the other hand has need of it. It tolerates the reactive life as a state of life close to zero__, it has need of it as a means by which life is led to deny and contradict itself. In this way victorious reactive forces have a witness, or worse, a leader. But what happens is that __the triumphant reactive forces are less and less tolerant of this leader and witness.__ They want to triumph alone, they no longer want to owe their triumph to anyone else.

p149

It is better to have no "will" at all than this over-powerful, over-lively will. It is better to have stagnant herds than the shepherd who persists in leading us too far.

What is pity? It is this tolerance for states of life close to zero. Pity is the love of life, but of the weak, sick, reactive life. It is militant and announces the final victory of the poor, the suffering, the powerless and the small
<!-- Weird take lol -->

p150

Pity is practical nihilism. . . pity persuades to nothingness. . .One does not say 'nothingness": one says 'the Beyond'; or 'God'; or 'true life'; or Nirvana, redemption, blessednes" (AC 7 pp. 118-119).

<!-- wtf. Maybe we understand pity very, very differently. -->

Pity for the reactive life in the name of higher values, God's pity for the reactive man

p151

Values can change, be renewed or even disappear. What does not change and does not disappear is the nihilistic perspective which governs this history from beginning to end and from which all these values (as well as their absence) arise. This is why Nietzsche can think that __nihilism is not an event in history but the motor of the history__ of man as universal history. Negative, reactive and passive nihilism: for Nietzsche one and the same history is marked out by Judaism, Christianity, the reformation, free thought, democratic and socialist ideology etc. Up until the last man.

<!-- yeah, hm, all is badly bad always, everywhere, all the time, ok -->

p152

__the universal appears as a hatred for life, the particular as a love of life__ - provided that it is sick and reactive.

p153

The Judaic consciousness puts God to death in the person of the Son: it invents a __God of love who would prefer to suffer from hate__ rather than find his premises and principle there.

In putting God to death it has found the way of making its God a God who is universal "for all" and truly cosmopolitan.

__God put his son on the cross out of love; we respond to this love__ to the extent that __we feel guilty__, guilty of this death, and we redress it by accusing ourselves, by paying interest on the debt. Through the love of God, through the sacrifice of his son, the whole of life becomes reactive.

p154

__love became the principle, undying hatred appears merely as a consequence of this love, the means to be used against anyone who resists this love. Warrior-Jesus, hateful-Jesus - but for the sake of love.__

The reactive life instead of the divine will, the reactive Man instead of God, the Man-God replacing the God-Man - the European Man.

p157

__The dialectic does not even skim the surface of interpretation,__ it never goes beyond the domain of symptoms. __It confuses interpretation with the development of the uninterpreted symbol.__ This is why, in questions of change and development, __it conceives of nothing deeper than an abstract permutation where the subject becomes predicate and the predicate, subject.__ But the one that is __subject and__ what the __predicate__ is __have not changed, they remain as little determined at the end as they were at the beginning, as little interpreted as possible__: everything has happened in the intermediate regions. 

It is not surprising that the dialectic proceeds by opposition, development of the opposition or contradiction and solution of the contradiction. It is unaware of the real element from which forces, their qualities and their relations derive; it only knows the inverted image of this element which is reflected in abstractly considered symptoms. 

Opposition can be the law of the relation between abstract products, but difference is the only principle of genesis or production; a principle which itself produces opposition as mere appearance. __Dialectic thrives on oppositions because it is unaware of far more subtle and subterranean differential mechanisms: topological displacements, typological variations.__

...

__Deprived of all its ambitions, opposition ceases to be formative__, impelling and co-ordinating: it becomes a symptom, nothing but a symptom to be interpreted. __Deprived of its claim to give an account of difference, contradiction appears for what it is: a perpetual misinterpretation of difference itself__, a confused inversion of genealogy.

p159

It is reactive forces that express themselves in opposition, the will to nothingness that expresses itself in the labour of the negative. __The dialectic is the natural ideology of ressentiment and bad conscience.__
