__Evaluations__, in essence, __are__ not values but __ways of being__, modes of existence of those who judge and evaluate, serving as principles for the values on the basis of which
they judge.


p3
__Critique is not a re-action of re-sentiment but the active expression of an active mode of existence; attack and not revenge, the natural aggression of a way of being,__ the divine wickedness without which perfection could not be imagined (EH 16-7). This way of being is that of the philosopher precisely because he intends to wield the differential element as critic and creator and therefore as a hammer. 

p3

All force is appropriation, domination, exploitation of a quantity of reality. Even __perception__, in its divers aspects, __is the expression of forces which appropriate nature.__

p3-4
__Sense__ is therefore a complex notion; there is always a plurality of senses, a constellation, a complex of successions but also of coexistences which make interpretation an art. "All subjugation, all domination amounts to a new interpretation."
[...]
There is no event, no phenomenon, word or thought which does not have a multiple sense. A thing is sometimes this, sometimes that, sometimes something more complicated-depending on the forces (the gods) which take possession of it.

p4

__religion does not have a unique sense,__ it serves many forces.

p6

Genealogy does not only interpret, it also evaluates. Up to now we have presented things as if different forces struggled over and took successive possession of an almost inert object. But __the object itself is force, expression of a force__. This is why there is more or less affinity between the object and the force which takes possession of it. __There is no object (phenomenon) which is not already possessed__ since in itself it is not an appearance but the apparition of a force.

p7

For __the will__ is not exercised mysteriously on muscles or nerves, still less on "matter in general", but __is necessarily exercised on another will.__ The real problem is not that of the relation of will to the involuntary but rather of the relation of a will that commands to a will that obeys - that obeys to a greater or lesser extent.

__The will is called a complex thing because insofar as it wills it wills obedience - but only a will can obey commands.__

__"In all willing it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on the basis of a social structure composed of many 'souls'"__ (BGE 19 p. 31) When Nietzsche praises egoism it is always in an aggressive or polemical way, against the virtues, against the virtue of disinterestedness (Z III "Of the Three Evil Things"). __But__ in fact __egoism is a bad interpretation of will, just as atomism is a bad interpretation of force.__ In order for there to be egoism it is necessary for there to be an ego. What directs us towards the origin is the fact that __every force is related to another, whether in order to command or to obey.__ The origin is the difference in the origin, difference in the origin is hierarchy, that is to say the relation of a dominant to a dominated force, of an obeyed to an obeying will.

p8

__Life struggles with another kind of life.__ Pluralism sometimes appears to be dialectical - but it is its most ferocious enemy, its
only profound enemy.

In Nietzsche __the essential relation of one force to another is never conceived of as a negative element__ in the essence. In its relation with the other __the force which makes itself obeyed does not deny the other or that which it is not, it affirms its own difference and *enjoys* this difference.__

p9

__The negate is not present in the essence__ as that from which force draws its activity: on the contrary __it is a result of activity__, of the existence of an active force and the affirmation of its difference.

As for the negative concept (that is to say, __negation as a concept__) "it __is only a subsequently-invented pale contrasting image in relation to its positive basic concept__ - filled with life and passion through and through" (GM 110 p. 37).

__For the speculative element of negation, opposition or contradiction Nietzsche substitutes the practical element of difference, the object of affirmation and enjoyment.__

The question which Nietzsche constantly repeats, "what does a will want, what does this one or that one want?", must not be understood as the search for a goal, a motive or an object for this will. __What a will wants is to affirm its difference.__ In its essential relation with the "other" a will makes its difference an object of affirmation.

Furthermore, we must ask what does the dialectician himself want?
__What does this will which wills the dialectic want? It is an exhausted force which does not have the strength to affirm its difference, a force which no longer acts but rather reacts to the forces which dominate it__ - only such a force brings to the foreground the negative element in its relation to the other. Such a force __denies all that it is not and makes this negation its own essence__ and the principle of its existence. "While every noble morality develops from a triumphant affirmation of itself, slave morality from the outset says No to what is 'outside', what is 'different' what is 'not itself and this No is its creative deed" (GM110 p. 36).

p10

This is why Nietzsche presents __the dialectic__ as the speculation of the pleb, as __the way of thinking of the slave__: __the abstract thought of contradiction then prevails over the concrete feeling of positive difference, reaction over action, *revenge and ressentiment take the place of aggression*.__

Moreover the __relation of master and slave is not, in itself, dialectical__. Who is the dialectician, who dialectises the relationship? It is the slave, the __slave's perspective__, the way of thinking belonging to the slave's perspective. __The famous dialectical aspect of the master-slave relationship depends on the fact that power is conceived not as will to power but as representation of power__, representation of superiority, recognition by "the one" of the superiority of "the other". 


What the wills in Hegel want is to have their power recognised,
to represent their power. According to Nietzsche we have here a __wholly erroneous conception of the will to power__ and its nature. This is the slave's conception, it is the image that the man of ressentiment has of power. __The slave only conceives of power as the object of a recognition, the content of a representation, the stake in a competition,__ and therefore makes it depend, at the end of a fight, on a simple attribution of established values.

...__the portrait of the master that Hegel offers us is, from the start, a portrait which represents the slave, at least as he is in his dreams, as at best a successful slave.__ Underneath the Hegelian image of the master we always find the slave.
