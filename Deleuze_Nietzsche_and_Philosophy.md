__Evaluations__, in essence, __are__ not values but __ways of being__, modes of existence of those who judge and evaluate, serving as principles for the values on the basis of which
they judge.


p3
__Critique is not a re-action of re-sentiment but the active expression of an active mode of existence; attack and not revenge, the natural aggression of a way of being,__ the divine wickedness without which perfection could not be imagined (EH 16-7). This way of being is that of the philosopher precisely because he intends to wield the differential element as critic and creator and therefore as a hammer. 

p3

All force is appropriation, domination, exploitation of a quantity of reality. Even __perception__, in its divers aspects, __is the expression of forces which appropriate nature.__

p3-4
__Sense__ is therefore a complex notion; there is always a plurality of senses, a constellation, a complex of successions but also of coexistences which make interpretation an art. "All subjugation, all domination amounts to a new interpretation."
[...]
There is no event, no phenomenon, word or thought which does not have a multiple sense. A thing is sometimes this, sometimes that, sometimes something more complicated-depending on the forces (the gods) which take possession of it.

p4
__religion does not have a unique sense,__ it serves many forces.
